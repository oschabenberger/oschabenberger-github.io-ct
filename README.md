# Computational and Quantitative Thinking

This material is the basis for an undergraduate-level course I teach in the Honors College of Virginia Tech.

There are no prerequisites for the material, except curiosity about the world of
data, analytics, probability, algorithms, and computation.

This "book" was written in Quarto because it combines prose with math and supports multiple programming languages and kernels within the same framework. To learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.
