# Correlation and Causation

:::{.centered}
Correlation describes the relationship (association) between things.
A person's weight is correlated with their height; taller people tend to be heavier.
\
\
Causation is the situation when one factor is the result of another.
Smoking causes an increase in the risk of lung cancer. The gravitational pull
of the moon on earth's oceans causes the tides. An accident causes a traffic jam.
:::

## Correlation is not Causation

:::{.quote .absolute top=20%}
Just because two variables have a statistical relationship with each other does not mean 
that one is responsible for the other.  For instance, ice cream sales and forest fires 
are correlated because both occur more often in the summer heat.  But there is no 
causation; you don't light a patch of the Montana brush on fire when you buy a
pint of HÃ¤agan-Dazs.

## Positive Correlation

When variables are continuous, we can show the association between two variables
as a point cloud (scatter plot).

## Strength of Correlation

:::{.maroon}
The strength of the linear correlation between continuous attributes is measured by the
correlation coefficient. It ranges from -1 to 1. A coefficient of 0 means no
(linear) correlation.

## Perfect Correlation

:::{.maroon}
All data points fall on a line. For example, conversion between degree C and Fahrenheit.

$$
^\circ F = {^\circ C} \times \frac{9}{5}  + 32
$$

damage on 236 agricultural fields was classified into
5 damage categories by two different inspectors.

: Results of rating 236 experimental units by 2 raters {#tbl-rater-agree .striped}

For example, 16 experimental units were assigned to damage category 3 by rater 1
and to damage category 2 by rater 2. There is relatively strong association 
between the ratings, the majority of the counts fall on the diagonal of the 
table and in the cells immediately off the diagonal (where the raters disagree
by one damage category).

:::

## Storks and Babies---The Data

Neyman (1952) published data on 54 counties that comprises the following attributes

- $W$: Number of women of child-bearing age in the county (in 10,000)
- $S$: Number of storks in the county
- $B$: Number of babies born in the county

[Analysis variables:]{.maroon}

* $Y = B/W$: birth rate per 10,000 women
* $X = S/W$: density of storks per 10,000 women

## Why is Establishing Causality Difficult?

:::{.incremental .highlight-last}
* [Causation is not Deterministic]{.maroon}
<br/>Not every smoker gets lung cancer, not every lung cancer is due to smoking
<br/>There is variability in the population
<br/>The cause does not trigger an effect every time, it increases the likelihood
that an effect occurs
<br/>
<br/>

* [Confounding Factors]{.maroon}
<br/>Affect both the factor and the effect
<br/>Can mask or distort the effect of variables
<br/>
<br/>

* [Experimentation often not possible]{.maroon}
<br/>Some systems cannot be manipulated (weather, economy)
<br/>Ethical considerations in applying harmful treatments or withholding promising ones
:::

## Dealing with Confounding Variables

* [Adjustments]{.maroon}
<br/>Include the confounding variables in models that capture the relationship
between target and factors of interest
<br/>

* [Stratification]{.maroon}
<br/>When the confounding variable is categorical (e.g., age group) perform
analysis separately for each age group
<br/>

* [Randomization]{.maroon}
<br/>Allow random selection or assignment to balance out the effects of
the confounding variables.

## Explanation

- Women were more likely to apply for subjects that have high application numbers 
and are more difficult to get in. 

- 64% of the applications from women went to Medicine and Veterinary Medicine 
(416 + 338 out of 1,184). 

- Only 30% of the male applications went to those subjects. 

- Men applied disproportionately more to Engineering, which has a higher 
acceptance rate than the other STEM disciplines. 

- The lower overall admission rate for women is the result in women applying in 
larger numbers to STEM disciplines that are difficult to get into.

Fluoride Exposure and IQ
::::
::::{.assignment-container}
The National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
conducted a **meta-analysis** of the relationship between fluoride intake and IQ.

Read the full [article from the National Toxicology Program here](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/noncancer/completed/fluoride)
and answer the following questions:

1. Did the study establish correlation or causation between fluoride intake and children's IQ?
2. Does the article make it clear whether to take the results as an indication of causation
or correlation?
3. What is meta-analysis?
4. How do you interpret the fact that the study did not analyze data from the U.S.?
Does that affect whether the results are applicable to U.S. children?
5. Can you think of confounding factors that limit transfer of the results to the U.S?

## Experiments in Social Sciences

[Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP)]{.maroon} 

Does being prayed for improve the recovery of patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery?

[Methods]{.maroon}

*  Patients at 6 US hospitals were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: 
    * Group 1 (604): intercessory prayer after being told they may or may not receive prayer
    * Group 2 (597): did not receive intercessory prayer after being told that they may or 
may not receive prayer
    * Group 3 (601): intercessory prayer after being informed they would receive prayer
    * Intercessory prayer was provided for 14 days, starting the night before surgery. 
    * Outcome was presence of any complication within 30 days of surgery

. . .

[Conclusion]{.maroon}

:::{.quote}
Intercessory prayer itself had no effect on complication-free recovery from CABG, 
but certainty of receiving intercessory prayer was associated with a higher 
incidence of complications.

## Experiments in Technology

* [A/B Testing]{.maroon}
<br/>Compare two conditions (A and B) of a product or web site 
<br/>Deploy both products/websites
<br/>Randomly assign customers to experience either A or B
<br/>Measure outcomes of interest (time on page, click-through rate, purchases, ...)

## Hill's Criteria

* [Named after Sir Author Bradford Hill]{.maroon}
<br/>Part of the research team that linked smoking to lung cancer
<br/>Established nine criteria to establish causality involving environmental exposure.

:::{.absolute left=60}
1. **Strength**: stronger association is stronger evidence of causality.
2. **Consistency**: similar studies by others give consistent findings.
3. **Specificity**: the more specific the association between a factor and an
effect, the more likely we are dealing with cause and effect. The association
is specific when the cause leads to only one outcome and the outcome can only come from
the one cause.
4. **Temporarlity**: the effect comes after the cause. 
5. **Gradient**: a dose-response curve exists.
6. **Plausibility**: the association makes sense based on known scientific facts.
7. **Coherence**: Interpretation of the data does not conflict with what is already known.
8. **Experimentation**: if experimentation is possible, it provides results in 
support of the causal hypothesis (provides strong evidence).
9. **Analogy**: Scientists can use prior knowledge and patterns to infer similar causal associations.

## Junior Seau

Tiaina Baul "Junior" Seau was an outstanding linebacker who played in the National
Football League for 20 years, mostly with the San Diego Chargers and also the
Miami Dolphins and New England Patriots. 

Junior Seau committed suicide in 2012 by shooting himself in the chest. 

An autopsy confirmed that Junior Seau had suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopahty
(CTE) believed due to repeated head trauma he experienced as a football player.

Causal Link between RHI and CTE
::::
::::{.assignment-container}
Read the article by Nowinski et al. about the causal relationship between
repeated head impacts (RHI) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) at 
[this link](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.938163/full).

It appears that the causal link between the two was settled throughout the 20^th^ 
century and later questioned again.

1. What reasons were given by some of the organizations involved in the debate 
(like CISG) to resist declaring a causal link between RHI and CTE?

2. What do you believe was their motivation to do so?

3. In the section *Understanding Causation*, the article examines each of 
Hill's nine criteria. Cite one argument from the article in support of each criterion.

4. Per the *Discussion* section of the article, what are valid reasons why 
scientists might remain skeptical of a causal link between RHI and CTE?

5. What language did the authors use in the *Conclusion* to indicate a causal
relationship between RHI and CTE?

6. Based on the evidence provided, should the conclusions drawn from data
about adult athletes be applied to children? Argue for or against and why or 
why not?
