<p><strong>Quantitative thinking</strong> (QT) is a problem-solving technique, like computational thinking. It views the world through measurable events, and approaches problems by analyzing quantitative evidence. At the heart of QT lies <strong>quantification</strong>, representing things in measurable quantities. The word quantification is rooted in the Latin word <em>quantus</em>, meaning “how much”. The purpose of quantification is to express things in numbers. The result is data in its many forms.</p>
<section id="benefits-of-quantification" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="benefits-of-quantification"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Benefits of Quantification</h2>
<p>The first obvious benefit of quantification is to make information amenable to mathematical and statistical operations. When mathematical or statistical calculations are concerned, any type of data will eventually be represented as numbers. A photograph turns into row and column indices of pixels and three-number triplets of red, green, and blue intensities. A sophisticated large language model that processes textual information converts the text into numeric representations, a process called <strong>encoding</strong>.</p>
<p>Quantification allows us to express relationships: ranking, ordering, and measuring proximity. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), for example, is use to measure the productivity of a country and is frequently used to rank countries and to delineate groups of countries. For example, a countries’ portion of global GPD is one of the criteria for G20 membership. Throughout history countries have competed for status. Quantifying status is a much better solution than determining status by sending soldiers and weapons across borders.</p>

<p>As we will see in a later chapter, sorting and searching are fundamental. Observe how many times a day you encounter sorted lists, rankings, top-ten results, best-of lists, most-preferred lists and other ways to arrange information by some metric of relevance. Google search would not be so successful if searching would not be combined with ranking results by relevance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>According to one view, the de-contextualized and value-free mathematical symbols used in statistical analyses assist in achieving objectivity, stability, and fairness in decisions. Quantification is a method of standardization that summarizes and reduces concepts to their essence and allows us to make better decisions. Quantification captures complex systems in easy to understand numbers. As some would argue <em>that works well on paper</em>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Huff_1954">Huff (<a href="references.html#ref-Huff_1954" role="doc-biblioref">1954</a>)</span>, in one of the most widely published statistics texts, <em>How to Lie with Statistics</em>, states</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>Many a statistic is false on its face. It gets by only because the<br>
magic of numbers brings about a suspension of common sense</p>
</div>
<p>Quantification certainly <strong>can</strong> achieve the goal of capturing complex systems and assisting with objective and fair decisions. We do have to apply a critical eye though and ask how a metric is defined, named, and determined. Just because you call something an index for X does not mean it is a good measure of X.</p>

<p>Exercise: Unemployment Rate, Consumer Price Index, Gross Domestic Product</p>
</div>
<div class="assignment-container">
<p>UR, CPI, and GDP are among the very important statistics reported by the government. They are used as indicators for the health and status of the economy and closely observed by economists, investors, politicians, …, well, everybody.</p>
<p>During the 2024 presidential election cycle in the U.S. these statistics indicated a strong economy. Yet many voters seemed to reject that idea. The disconnect between the reported reality of the economy and the public’s perception of the economy was baffling to many politicians. How can the public believe that the economy is bad if unemployment rate is at a low 4.2%?</p>
<p>Rather than pointing the finger at group think and social media echo chambers, <span class="citation" data-cites="Ludwig_2025">Ludwig (<a href="references.html#ref-Ludwig_2025" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a>)</span> raises an interesting question in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/02/11/democrats-tricked-strong-economy-00203464">this article</a> in Politico:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if the government statistics we rely on as indicators of economic well being are not really measuring what we think they are? What if they are fundamentally flawed and those flaws create the discrepancy between reality and theory?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a question of partisan politics. The three statistics have been in place for a long time and are calculated the same way regardless of which party holds sway. It is a question of whether the government’s measurements properly capture the realities of the economy as a whole. Ludwig argues that unemployment is higher, wages are lower and growth is not as robust as the three government statistics suggest.</p>

<li><p>For each of the three statistics (U<sub>3</sub> for unemployment, CPI, and GDP) list the reasons cited in <span class="citation" data-cites="Ludwig_2025">Ludwig (<a href="references.html#ref-Ludwig_2025" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a>)</span> why the statistic fails to measure economic reality.</p></li>

<p>When dealing with inherently measurable attributes such as height or weight, quantification is simple. We need an agreed-upon method of measuring and a system to express the measurement in. The former might be an electronic scale or an analog scale with counterweights for weight measurement, a ruler, yardstick, or laser device for height measurements. It seems obvious to report weights in metric units of milligrams, grams, pounds (500 grams), kilograms, and tons or in U.S. Customary units of ounces, pounds (16 ounces), and tons. As long as we know which measurement units apply, we can all agree on how heavy something is. And we need to keep in mind that the same word can represent different things: a metric pound is 500 grams, a U.S. pound is 453.6 grams. But wait, there is more: Apothecaries’ weights are slightly different, a pound a.p. is 12 ounces. And in some fields, weights are measured entirely differently, diamonds are measured in carats (0.2 grams). In the International System of Units (SI), weight is measured in Newtons, which is gravitational force on a mass, equivalent to kg * m /s<sup>2</sup>. As long as we know what units are used to report a weight, we can convert it into whatever system we want to use. So we could say that this attribute is easily quantifiable—although there are always wrinkles.</p>
<p>Some attributes are easy to quantify once we have agreed on a definition and methodology to turn concept into numbers. The unemployment rate and the Consumer Price Index from the previous exercise are examples. We can count employed and unemployed folks and compute the ratio <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\# \text{unemployed}}{\# \text{(employed + unemployed)}}
\]</span> The difficulty is to define what constitutes employment or unemployment. Is seasonal work employment? Is an occasional gig job unemployment? How do you capture those who have stopped looking for a job after 200 failed job applications?</p>
<p>Other attributes are genuinely difficult to quantify by their very nature. They elude a definition we could agree upon. How do you measure happiness? Finland has been declared the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0hmcc91/why-is-finland-the-happiest-country-in-the-world-">happiest country</a> on earth for seven years running. This must involve some form of quantification otherwise we could not rank countries and declare one as “best”. How did they come up with that? The purpose of the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2024/happiness-of-the-younger-the-older-and-those-in-between/">World Happiness Report</a> is to review the science of measuring well-being and to use survey measures of life satisfaction across 150 countries. <em>Happiness</em> according to the World Happiness Report is a combination of many other measurements. For example, a rating of one’s overall life satisfaction, the ability to own a home, the availability of public transportation, etc. Clearly, there is a subjective element in choosing the measurable attributes that are supposed to allow inference about the difficult to measure attribute <em>happiness</em>. Not all attributes weigh equally in the determination of happiness, the weighing scheme itself is part of the quantification. Norms and values also must play a role. The availability of public transportation affects quality of life differently in rural Arkansas and in downtown London. In short, the process of how we quantify a difficult-to-measure attribute should be part of the conversation.</p>

<p>Variables are difficult to quantify for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inconsistent views about what they mean—how do you measure freedom?</li>

<p>You can easily grow the list and find examples of difficult-to-quantify variables from many fields. It is a common problem in many sciences: what we are interested in measuring is difficult to quantify and the process of quantification is full of assumptions. Instead of getting at the phenomenon directly, we use other quantities to inform about all or parts of what we are really interested in. These <strong>surrogates</strong> are known by different names: we call them an indicator, an index (such as the consumer price index), a metric, a score, and so on.</p>

<p>Example: Net Promoter Score (NPS)</p>
</div>
<div class="example-container">
<p>Building on the theme of “happiness”, a frequent question asked by companies that sell products or services is “are my customers satisfied and are they loyal?”</p>
<p>Rather than an extensive survey with many questions as in the World Happiness Report, the question of customer satisfaction and loyalty is often distilled into a single metric in the business world, the Net Promoter Score (NPS). NPS is considered by many the gold standard customer experience metric. It rests on a single question: “How likely are you to recommend the companies products or services?”</p>
<p>The calculation of NPS is as follows (<a href="#fig-nps" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.1</span></a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers answer the question on a scale of 0–10, with 0 being not at all likely to recommend and 10 being extremely likely to recommend.</li>
<li>Based on their response, customers are categorized as promoters, passives, or detractors. A detractor is someone whose answer was between 0 and 6. A promoter is someone whose answer is 9 or 10. The others, which responded with a 7 or 8 are passives.</li>
<li>The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NPS ranges from -100 to 100, higher scores imply more promoters. A NPS of 100 is achieved if everyone scores 9 or 10. A score of -100 is achieved if everyone scores 6 or below.</p>

Important: cultural differences, someone cannot be detractor and promoter at the
same time, division of range is arbitrary, tries to distill a complex relationship
in a single number, depends on how and who you ask among the customers.

Whether you recommend something or detract from something depends on who you
are talking to. You might recommend a product to a peer but not to your parents.

Fewer than those designated as promoters have actually promoted the brand.
It measures intention, not behavior

NPS does not explain why someone would recommend a product: ease of use,
price, customer service, availability, ... It also does not explain why someone
detracts from a product. How are you going to fix things?

<p>An <strong>indicator</strong> is a quantitative or qualitative factor or variable that offers a direct, simple, unique and reliable signal or means to measure achievements.</p>
<p>The economy is a complex system for the distribution of goods and services. Such a complex system defies quantification by a single number. Instead, we use thousands of indicators to give us insight into a particular aspect of the economy: inflation rates, consumer price indices, unemployment numbers, gross domestic product, economic activity, etc.</p>

</ol>
<p>What are the indicators used for–that is, what do they indicate?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An indicator is called <strong>leading</strong> if it is predictive, informing us about what might happen in the future. The job satisfaction in an employee survey is a leading indicator of employee attrition in the future. Unhappy employees are more likely to quit and to move on to other jobs. A <strong>lagging</strong> indicator is descriptive, it looks at what has happened in the past. Last month’s resignation rate is a lagging indicator for the human resources department.</p>
<hr>
<p>When multiple indicators are combined, we sometimes call it an <strong>index</strong>, although the distinction is not sharp. Indicators can also be the result of aggregation so that the distinction between indicator and index becomes one of degree of combining information (with an index being more aggregated or combining more individual pieces of information). In some domains, the word index is simply used more frequently than indicators, and vice versa.</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="example-header">
<p>Example: Body Mass Index (BMI)</p>
</div>
<div class="example-container">
<p>The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a medical screening tool for certain health conditions. Colloquially, it is understood as a measure of “fatness”. That is not quite correct, in most people, BMI only <strong>correlates</strong> with body fat. We will learn more about the concept of correlation (association) later. BMI has become the standard indicator for obesity.</p>
<p>The calculation of BMI involves two variables (two indicators): a person’s weight in kilograms (kg) and their height in meters (m): <span class="math display">\[
\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight in kg}}{(\text{Height in m})^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that the height is squared in the denominator. If you prefer to work in U.S. pounds and inches, the calculation is <span class="math display">\[
\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight in lbs} \times 703}{(\text{Height in inches})^2}
  \]</span></p>
<p>In my case (6’3” tall, 208 lbs), the BMI is (208 )/(75^2) = 25.9. According to BMI charts such as <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9464-body-mass-index-bmi">this one</a> at the Cleveland Clinic, I am in the overweight range.</p>
<p>BMI is used widely by medical professionals. People with low values might be at risk for developing anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, malnutrition, and a weakened immune system. High values can indicate a higher risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, osteoarthritis, sleep apenea, depression, and certain cancers.</p>
<p>Geez. It seems that unless you are in the optimal BMI range you are either bound for osteoporosis or osteoarthritis. No wonder folks are obsessing over their BMI.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9464-body-mass-index-bmi">Cleveland Clinic</a> is quick to point out:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>It’s important to remember that you could have any of the above health conditions without having a high BMI. Similarly, you could have a high BMI without having any of these conditions.<br>
…<br>
It’s important to remember that body fatness isn’t the only determiner of overall health. Several other factors, such as genetics, activity level, smoking cigarettes or using tobacco, drinking alcohol and mental health conditions all affect your overall health and your likelihood of developing certain medical conditions.</p>
</div>
<p>And</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>The standard BMI chart has limitations for various reasons. Because of this,<br>
it’s important to not put too much emphasis on your BMI.</p>
</div>
<p>People who are muscular can have a high BMI and still have very low fat mass. The BMI does not distinguish between lean body mass and fat body mass. BMI charts do not distinguish between males and females, although females tend to have more body fat (says the Cleveland Clinic!). People today are taller than when the BMI was developed. The BMI charts do not apply to athletes, children, pregnant people, or the elderly.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>Even though the BMI chart can be inaccurate for certain people, healthcare providers still use it<br>
because it’s the quickest tool for assessing a person’s estimated body fat amount.</p>

<p>Ah, so it is used because it is easy to calculate, not because it is particularly useful or accurate.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Current BMI-based measures of obesity can both underestimate and overestimate adiposity and provide inadequate information about health at the individual level, which undermines medically-sound approaches to health care and policy.</p>
</div>
<p>Based on this article, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bmi-is-bogus-best-way-to-tell-if-youre-a-healthy-weight-2016-9">Business Insider</a> went a step further, calling BMI <strong>bogus</strong>. Having “obesity” according to the BMI scale does not mean a person is unhealthy. In fact, BMI does not tell you anything about the health of a person.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to examine how BMI came about. The comment above about the increasing height of people suggests that BMI was developed some time ago. Indeed. It was invented for an entirely different reason, to describe a population average man in Western Europe in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>To make this connection we need to introduce Adolphe Quetelet (1796–1847), who invented the BMI to quantify a population according to its person’s weight. It was initially called the <em>Quetelet index</em>. Quetelet was a Belgian astronomer, statistician, and mathematician—not a medical professional. He studied the distribution of physical attributes in populations of French and Scottish people. Quetelet determined that the <em>normal</em>, the most representative value of an attribute, is its average. Prior to Quetelet, the idea of “norm” and “normality” was associated with carpentry and construction. The carpenter square is also called the norm and in normal construction everything is at right angles. The classical notion of ideal as an unattainable beauty up to this time was reflected in great works of art.</p>
<p>Quetelet focused on the middle of the distribution as the “new normal” and saw <em>l’homme moyen</em>, the average man, as the ideal <span class="citation" data-cites="GrueHeiberg">(<a href="references.html#ref-GrueHeiberg" role="doc-biblioref">Grue and Heiberg 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There is no association with health, and there is no association with the individual. The BMI as developed by Quetelet was supposed to describe the average in a population, not obesity of the individual. The population it was intended to describe is French and Scottish of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Going from there to a near universal measure of obesity since the 1970s is quite the stretch.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-data-types"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Types of Data</h2>
<p>Data, the result of quantification, can be classified in a number of ways. The first distinction of quantified variables is by <strong>data type</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Continuous</strong>: the number of possible values of the variable is not countable. Examples are physical measurements such as weight, height, length, pressure, temperature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discrete</strong>: the number of possible values is countable. Even if the number of possible values is infinite, the variable is still discrete. The number of fish caught per day does not have a theoretical upper limit, although it is highly unlikely that a weekend warrior will catch 1,000 fish. A commercial fishing vessel might.<br>
<br>
Discrete variables are further divided into the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Count Variables</strong>: the values are true counts, obtained by enumeration. There are two types of counts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Counts per unit</strong>: the count relates to a unit of measurement, e.g., the number of fish caught per day, the number of customer complaints per quarter, the number of chocolate chips per cookie, the number of cancer incidences per 100,000.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proportions (Counts out of a total)</strong>: the count can be converted to a proportion by dividing it with a maximum value. Examples are the number of heads out of 10 coin tosses, the number of larvae out of 20 succumbing to an insecticide,</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Categorical Variables</strong>: the values consist of labels, even if numbers are used for labeling.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Nominal variables</strong>: The labels are unordered, for example the variable “fruit” takes on the values “apple”, “peach”, “tomato” (yes, tomatoes are fruit but do not belong in fruit salad).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ordinal variables</strong>: the category labels can be arranged in a natural order in a lesser-greater sense. Examples are 1—5 star reviews or ratings of severity (“mild”, “modest”, “severe”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Binary variables</strong>: take on exactly two values (dead/alive, Yes/No, 1/0, fraud/not fraud, diseased/not diseased)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Categorical variables are also called <strong>qualitative</strong> variables. They encode a quality, namely to belong to one of the categories. All other variables are also called <strong>quantitative</strong> variables. Note that quantifying something through numbers does not imply it is a quantitative variable. Highway exits might have numbers that are simple identifiers not related to distances. The number of stars on a 5-star rating scale indicates the category, not a quantified amount. The numeric values of quantitative variables, on the other hand, can be used to calculate meaningful differences and ratios. 40 kg is twice as much as 20 kg, but a 4-star review is not twice as much as a 2-star review—it is simply higher than a 2-star review.</p>

<section id="uncertainty" class="level2" data-number="2.5">
<h2 data-number="2.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="uncertainty"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Uncertainty</h2>
<p>When I hop on the scales in the bathroom in the morning, I usually take two or three measurements in quick succession. They rarely are identical, differing by a fraction of a pound. Day-to-day variation could be understandable, our weight does change over time. But second-to-second variation, that seems odd. It seems unlikely that I gained or lost a quarter pound over the last 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Quantifying things is associated with <strong>uncertainty</strong> that is introduced through various forms of <strong>variability</strong>. My weight measurement varies from one measurement to the next because of my posture, movement on the scales, and the performance of the scales mechanism itself. Not because my actual weight differs. This type of variability is called <strong>measurement error</strong>. If we measure the weights of students in a classroom another source of variability is introduced, subject-to-subject variability. If we randomly choose a classroom from the school, the measurements also represent classroom-to-classroom variability, since repeating the process and selecting a different classroom will yield a different number.</p>
<p>In the presence of uncertainty, quantities are not knowable a priori. But if the uncertainty itself can be quantified, then the quantity of interest is predictable. I am unable to say what the average weight is of a student in a freshman class. But by measuring weights and quantifying uncertainty in the observations I can <strong>predict</strong> with a high level of confidence that the average freshmen students’ weight is between this much and that much (now attach your favorite weight units).</p>
<p>It is one of humanities’ great advances that we are not only able to represent concepts in numbers, but that we can quantify uncertainty itself. Probability and statistics enable us to learn from uncertain events and measurements. This adds to our vocabulary of lengths, weights, volumes, five-star ratings, and so on, the terms prediction, forecast, likelihood, odds, chance, and probability.</p>
<p>A meteorologist forecasting a 30% chance of rain tomorrow is quantifying the likelihood of an event. We all know how to operationalize this forecast. The higher the number, the more likely we will need an umbrella the next day. Interestingly, while we have developed intuition about “the chance of rain”, many do not know how to correctly interpret a statement such as “30% chance of rain”. It does not mean that 30% of the area covered by the forecast will see rain. It does not mean that on days like today, 30% of them will have a rain event. Rather, it means that there is a 0.3 probability that <strong>any</strong> point in the forecast area will see a measurable amount of rain (usually 0.01 inches or more).</p>
<p>Another interpretation flows from the fact that weather forecasts are based on models that simulate weather conditions based on inputs. To account for the inherent uncertainty in measuring the inputs, multiple scenarios (simulations) are run. a 30% chance of rain means that 30% of the simulations predicted rain for the forecast area.</p>
<hr>
<p>By applying statistical principles in the analysis of data uncertainty can be reduced. More informed insights about the data are then possible. Suppose we want to measure the average amount of an attribute in a population—say, the average years of postgraduate education. The population is too large to visit with every member so we instead quiz only a smaller number about their education. If we randomly sample one person from the population, we get a statistically valid estimate for the entire population. If they have 2 years of postgraduate education, our best guess for the average amount of post-graduate education in the entire population is 2 years. However, we have not reduced the uncertainty at all, the single measurement is as uncertain as the variability of postgraduate education years in the population. Suppose this variability can be quantified with the amount <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. If we repeat the process of randomly sampling persons <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> more times and computing the average across the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> measurements—this is called the <strong>sample average</strong>—we get a much better estimate of the average number of years of postgraduate education in the population. It turns out that the sample average so obtained has uncertainty <span class="math inline">\(X/n\)</span>. In other words, we can make our statement about the population quantity of interest arbitrarily precise by sampling a large number of people from the population.</p>
<p>For attributes with large variability <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> it will take a larger sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to achieve the same level of precision compared to attributes with less variability. If the attribute does not vary at all in the population (<span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span>), then a single sample is sufficient. In the population of apartment renters there is no variability in the attribute <em>renter</em>, but there is variability in the attribute <em>amount of rent late</em>.</p>

<li>They can lead to oversimplification and misinterpretation.</li>

<section id="surrogation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="surrogation">Surrogation</h3>
<p><strong>Surrogation</strong> occurs when people or organizations substitute a metric for the underlying concept or goal that the metric is intended to represent. Instead of treating the metric as a proxy or tool to measure progress, they treat it as the ultimate goal itself. The metric has become the goal. Surrogates are good. Surrogation is bad.</p>
<p>When standardized test scores are a surrogate for student achievement, surrogation means to focus on driving up the test scores rather than focusing on driving actual student achievement.</p>
<p>Someone can obsess over BMI (body mass index), trying to improve their BMI but not getting any healthier.</p>
<p>Surrogation of net promoter scores occurs when companies focus on driving up NPS by only asking customers that repeatedly buy their product. The goal is to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, the NPS should increase as a result. Surrogation focuses on the NPS, not the actual customer satisfaction. The first mistake in surrogation is to assume that the surrogate is exactly what it is a proxy for. To assume that the net promoter score is a proxy for customer satisfaction it is not customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Sales people are often incentivized on number of deals or deal volume (revenue). The underlying goal is to drive success for the company. Surrogation can lead to closing of deals that are bad for the company (losing money on the deal) but work in favor of the sales person’s metric to hit a revenue target.</p>
<hr>
<p>When metrics are tied to performance evaluation, resource assignment, advancement, surrogation is common. It leads to distorted priorities and bad behavior (gaming the system): people try to meet the metric without achieving the underlying goal.</p>
<p>Another negative aspect of surrogation is to prioritize the simple fixes and quick wins instead of the deeper but more expensive and difficult corrections. A hospital might focus on amenities or quick ER service rather than improving health outcomes for its patients. A social media content creator generates click bait in order to increase clicks rather than focusing on meaningful engagement.</p>
