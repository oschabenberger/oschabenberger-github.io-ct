Not enough of our society is trained how to understand and interpret quantitative information. This activity is a centerpiece of science literacy to which we should all strive—the future health, wealth, and security of our democracy depend on it. Until that is achieved, we are at risk of making under-informed decisions that affect ourselves, our communities, our country, and even the world.\

**Quantitative thinking** (QT) is a problem-solving technique, like computational
thinking. It views the world through measurable events, and approaches problems
by analyzing quantitative evidence. At the heart of QT lies **quantification**,
representing things in measurable quantities. The word quantification is rooted 
in the Latin word *quantus*, meaning "how much". The purpose of quantification is 
to express things in numbers. The result is data in its many forms.

## Benefits of Quantification

The first obvious benefit of quantification is to make information amenable to
mathematical and statistical operations. When mathematical or statistical calculations
are concerned, any type of data will eventually be represented as numbers. A
photograph turns into row and column indices of pixels and three-number triplets
of red, green, and blue intensities. A sophisticated large language model that 
processes textual information converts the text into numeric representations, 
a process called **encoding**.

Quantification allows us to express relationships: ranking, ordering, and measuring
proximity. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), for example, is use to measure 
the productivity of a country and is frequently used to rank countries and 
to delineate groups of countries. For example, a countries' portion of global GPD 
is one of the criteria for G20 membership. Throughout history countries have 
competed for status. Quantifying status is a much better solution than determining 
status by sending soldiers and weapons across borders. 

:::{.callout-note}
As we will see in a later chapter, sorting and searching are fundamental.
Observe how many times a day you encounter sorted lists, rankings,
top-ten results, best-of lists, most-preferred lists and other ways to arrange
information by some metric of relevance. Google search would not be so successful if
searching would not be combined with ranking results by relevance.
:::

According to one view, the de-contextualized and value-free mathematical symbols 
used in statistical analyses assist in achieving objectivity, stability, and fairness
in decisions. Quantification is a method of standardization that summarizes
and reduces concepts to their essence and allows us to make better decisions.
Quantification captures complex systems in easy to understand numbers. As some
would argue *that works well on paper*.

@Huff_1954, in one of the most widely published statistics texts, *How to Lie with
Statistics*, states

:::{.quote}
Many a statistic is false on its face. It gets by only because the \
magic of numbers brings about a suspension of common sense
:::

Quantification certainly **can** achieve the goal of capturing complex systems
and assisting with objective and fair decisions. We do have to apply a critical 
eye though and ask how a metric is defined, named, and determined. Just because 
you call something an index for X does not mean it is a good measure of X.

Exercise: Unemployment Rate, Consumer Price Index, Gross Domestic Product
::::
::::{.assignment-container}
UR, CPI, and GDP are among the very important statistics reported by the government.
They are used as indicators for the health and status of the economy
and closely observed by economists, investors, politicians, ..., well, everybody.

During the 2024 presidential election cycle in the U.S. these statistics indicated
a strong economy. Yet many voters seemed to reject that idea. The disconnect 
between the reported reality of the economy and the public's perception of the 
economy was baffling to many politicians. How can the public believe that the 
economy is bad if unemployment rate is at a low 4.2%?

Rather than pointing the finger at group think and social media echo chambers, 
@Ludwig_2025 raises an interesting question in [this article](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/02/11/democrats-tricked-strong-economy-00203464) 
in Politico: 

* What if the government statistics we rely on as indicators of economic well being 
are not really measuring what we think they are? What if they are fundamentally 
flawed and those flaws create the discrepancy between reality and theory?

This is not a question of partisan politics. The three statistics have been 
in place for a long time and are calculated the same way regardless of which 
party holds sway. It is a question of whether the government’s measurements properly 
capture the realities of the economy as a whole. Ludwig argues that unemployment 
is higher, wages are lower and growth is not as robust as the three government 
statistics suggest.

1. For each of the three statistics (U~3~ for unemployment, CPI, and GDP) 
list the reasons cited in @Ludwig_2025 why the statistic fails to measure
economic reality.

2. If the values of the statistics were adjusted in the way suggested in the
article, how would the reported values change?

3. Is @Ludwig_2025 arguing that the current statistics are without merit
and should be abandoned?

## Easy and Difficult to Quantify

When dealing with inherently measurable attributes such as height or weight, 
quantification is simple. We need an agreed-upon method of measuring and a system to express
the measurement in. The former might be an electronic scale or an analog scale
with counterweights for weight measurement, a ruler, yardstick, or laser device
for height measurements. It seems obvious to report weights in metric units of 
milligrams, grams, pounds (500 grams), kilograms, and tons or in U.S. Customary units of ounces, 
pounds (16 ounces), and tons. As long as we know which measurement units apply, we can 
all agree on how heavy something is. And we need to keep in mind that the same
word can represent different things: a metric pound is 500 grams, a U.S. pound
is 453.6 grams. But wait, there is more: Apothecaries' weights are slightly 
different, a pound a.p. is 12 ounces. And in some fields, weights are measured
entirely differently, diamonds are measured in carats (0.2 grams). In the 
International System of Units (SI), weight is measured in Newtons, which is 
gravitational force on a mass, equivalent to kg * m /s^2^.
As long as we know what units are used to report a weight, we can convert it 
into whatever system we want to use. So we could say that this attribute is easily
quantifiable---although there are always wrinkles. 

Some attributes are easy to quantify once we have agreed on a definition and
methodology to turn concept into numbers. The unemployment rate and the Consumer
Price Index from the previous exercise are examples. We can count employed and
unemployed folks and compute the ratio
$$
\frac{\# \text{unemployed}}{\# \text{(employed + unemployed)}}
$$
The difficulty is to define what constitutes employment or unemployment. Is 
seasonal work employment? Is an occasional gig job unemployment? How do you
capture those who have stopped looking for a job after 200 failed job applications?

Other attributes are genuinely difficult to quantify by their very nature. They
elude a definition we could agree upon. How do you measure happiness? Finland
has been declared the [happiest country](https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0hmcc91/why-is-finland-the-happiest-country-in-the-world-) 
on earth for seven years running. This must involve some form of quantification
otherwise we could not rank countries and declare one as "best". 
How did they come up with that? The purpose of the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2024/happiness-of-the-younger-the-older-and-those-in-between/)
is to review the science of measuring well-being and to use survey measures of 
life satisfaction across 150 countries. *Happiness* according to the World Happiness
Report is a combination of many other measurements. For example, a rating of
one's overall life satisfaction, the ability to own a home, the availability of
public transportation, etc. Clearly, there is a subjective element in choosing
the measurable attributes that are supposed to allow inference about the 
difficult to measure attribute *happiness*. Not all attributes weigh equally in
the determination of happiness, the weighing scheme itself is part of the quantification.
Norms and values also must play a role. The availability of public transportation
affects quality of life differently in rural Arkansas and in downtown London. 
In short, the process of how we quantify a difficult-to-measure attribute should be
part of the conversation.

Variables are difficult to quantify for various reasons:

- Inconsistent views about what they mean---how do you measure freedom?
- Difficult to define---what is trust?
- Subjectivity---introversion
- Abstract concepts---creativity, natural beauty, etc. 

Here is a short list of difficult-to-quantify concepts from different areas:

##### Personal and Psychological Attributes

 - **Emotions**: Happiness, sadness, or anxiety levels can be challenging to 
 measure as they are subjective and context-dependent.
 - **Personality traits**: Attributes like openness, conscientiousness, or 
 introversion often rely on self-reporting and are hard to measure precisely.
 - **Self-esteem**: The internal sense of self-worth varies across situations 
 and over time.
 - **Empathy**: Understanding the emotions of others is influenced by individual 
 perception.
 - **Intelligence**: there are different forms of intelligence (emotional, spatial,
 linguistic, musical, etc.). IQ tests provide incomplete pictures.

##### Social and Cultural Variables

 - **Social cohesion**: The sense of community and connection within a group.
 - **Cultural values**: Abstract beliefs such as collectivism or individualism 
 differ across societies.
 - **Trust**: The degree of confidence people have in others or institutions 
 can be highly context-sensitive.
 - **Social norms**: Expectations about behavior that are implicit and vary 
 among groups.

##### Ethical and Moral Attributes

 - **Fairness**: What is considered "fair" depends on personal, cultural, and contextual factors.
 - **Integrity**
 - **Justice**: Varied interpretations of what constitutes equitable treatment or outcomes.

##### Creative and Artistic Variables

 - **Creativity**: Measuring originality and innovation is inherently subjective.
 - **Aesthetic appeal**: People's appreciation of beauty is highly personal and 
 culturally influenced.
 - **Talent**

##### Environmental and Ecological Factors

 - **Biodiversity value**: The intrinsic worth of maintaining species diversity 
  is challenging to calculate in monetary or ecological terms.
 - **Ecosystem health**: Assessing overall resilience, productivity, or 
  stability of ecosystems involves many interdependent variables.
 - **Natural beauty**

##### Economic and Market Variables

 - **Brand loyalty** is an emotional attachment to a product or service.
 - **Consumer satisfaction**: Highly subjective and influenced by expectations 
 and individual preferences.
Innovation potential: The likelihood that a new product or idea will succeed in the market.

##### Abstract Concepts

 - **Freedom**: The degree to which individuals or groups are free can depend on legal, social, and personal dimensions.
 - **Happiness**: The overall well-being of a population is a composite of 
 subjective factors.
 - **Potential**: The latent ability for growth or success in individuals or systems.

You can easily grow the list and find examples of difficult-to-quantify variables
from many fields. It is a common problem in many sciences: what we are interested 
in measuring is difficult to quantify and the process of quantification is full of 
assumptions. Instead of getting at the phenomenon directly, we use
other quantities to inform about all or parts of what we are really interested
in. These **surrogates** are known by different names: we call them an indicator, 
an index (such as the consumer price index), a metric, a score, and so on. 

:::{.example}
::::{.example-header}
Example: Net Promoter Score (NPS)
::::
::::{.example-container}
Building on the theme of "happiness", a frequent question asked by companies that
sell products or services is "are my customers satisfied and are they loyal?"

Rather than an extensive survey with many questions as in the World Happiness
Report, the question of customer satisfaction and loyalty is often distilled into 
a single metric in the business world, the Net Promoter Score (NPS).
NPS is considered by many the gold standard customer experience metric. It 
rests on a single question: "How likely are you to recommend the companies
products or services?"

The calculation of NPS is as follows (@fig-nps):

- Customers answer the question on a scale of 0–10, with 0 being not at all likely 
to recommend and 10 being extremely likely to recommend.
- Based on their response, customers are categorized as promoters, passives, or 
detractors. A detractor is someone whose answer was between 0 and 6. A promoter
is someone whose answer is 9 or 10. The others, which responded with a 7 or 8 are
passives.
- The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the 
percentage of promoters. 

The NPS ranges from -100 to 100, higher scores imply more promoters. A NPS of
100 is achieved if everyone scores 9 or 10. A score of -100 is achieved if
everyone scores 6 or below.

For some answers see here:

https://hbr.org/2019/10/where-net-promoter-score-goes-wrong

Important: cultural differences, someone cannot be detractor and promoter at the
same time, division of range is arbitrary, tries to distill a complex relationship
in a single number, depends on how and who you ask among the customers.

Whether you recommend something or detract from something depends on who you
are talking to. You might recommend a product to a peer but not to your parents.

Fewer than those designated as promoters have actually promoted the brand.
It measures intention, not behavior

NPS does not explain why someone would recommend a product: ease of use,
price, customer service, availability, ... It also does not explain why someone
detracts from a product. How are you going to fix things?

The NPS has many detractors, pun intended. Some describe it as "management 
snake oil". Management touts it when the NPS goes up, nobody reports it when
it goes down. It continues to be widely used. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2019/05/21/its-time-to-retire-the-net-promoter-score/) reported that in 50 earnings calls of S&P 500 companies NPS was mentioned 150 
times in 2018.

## Indicator and Index

An **indicator** is a quantitative or qualitative factor or variable that offers a 
direct, simple, unique and reliable signal or means to measure achievements.

The economy is a complex system for the distribution of goods and services. 
Such a complex system defies quantification by a single number.
Instead, we use thousands of indicators to give us insight into a particular
aspect of the economy: inflation rates, consumer price indices, unemployment 
numbers, gross domestic product, economic activity, etc.

:::{.assignment}
::::{.assignment-header}

1. International trade
2. Housing and construction
3. Consumer spending
4. Manufacturing
5. Climate
6. Labor markets

What are the indicators used for--that is, what do they indicate?
::::
:::

An indicator is called **leading** if it is predictive, informing us about what
might happen in the future. The job satisfaction in an employee survey is a 
leading indicator of employee attrition in the future. Unhappy employees are
more likely to quit and to move on to other jobs. A **lagging** indicator is
descriptive, it looks at what has happened in the past. Last month's resignation
rate is a lagging indicator for the human resources department.

---

When multiple indicators are combined, we sometimes call it an **index**, although
the distinction is not sharp. Indicators can also be the result of aggregation
so that the distinction between indicator and index becomes one of degree of
combining information (with an index being more aggregated or combining more
individual pieces of information). In some domains, the word index is simply
used more frequently than indicators, and vice versa.

:::{.example}
::::{.example-header}
Example: Body Mass Index (BMI)
::::
::::{.example-container}
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a medical screening tool for certain health conditions.
Colloquially, it is understood as a measure of "fatness". That is not quite correct,
in most people, BMI  only **correlates** with body fat. We will learn more about 
the concept of correlation (association) later. BMI has become the standard indicator
for obesity.

The calculation of BMI involves two variables (two indicators): a person's weight
in kilograms (kg) and their height in meters (m):
$$
\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight in kg}}{(\text{Height in m})^2}
$$

 Notice that the height is squared in the denominator. If you prefer to work in
 U.S. pounds and inches, the calculation is
 $$
 \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight in lbs} \times 703}{(\text{Height in inches})^2}
  $$
 
In my case (6'3" tall, 208 lbs), the BMI is (208 \times 703)/(75^2) = 25.9.
According to BMI charts such as [this one](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9464-body-mass-index-bmi) 
at the Cleveland Clinic, I am in the overweight range.

BMI is used widely by medical professionals. People with low values might be at
risk for developing anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, malnutrition, and a 
weakened immune system. High values can indicate a higher risk for heart disease,
high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, osteoarthritis, sleep apenea,
depression, and certain cancers. 

Geez. It seems that unless you are in the optimal BMI range you are either bound
for osteoporosis or osteoarthritis. No wonder folks are obsessing over their BMI.

The [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9464-body-mass-index-bmi) 
is quick to point out:

:::{.quote}
It’s important to remember that you could have any of the above health conditions 
without having a high BMI. Similarly, you could have a high BMI without having 
any of these conditions.\
...\
It’s important to remember that body fatness isn’t the only determiner of overall 
health. Several other factors, such as genetics, activity level, smoking cigarettes 
or using tobacco, drinking alcohol and mental health conditions all affect your 
overall health and your likelihood of developing certain medical conditions.
:::

And 

:::{.quote}
The standard BMI chart has limitations for various reasons. Because of this, \
it’s important to not put too much emphasis on your BMI.
:::

People who are muscular can have a high BMI and still have very low fat mass. The 
BMI does not distinguish between lean body mass and fat body mass. BMI charts do
not distinguish between males and females, although females tend to have more
body fat (says the Cleveland Clinic!). People today are taller than when the BMI
was developed. The BMI charts do not apply to athletes, children, pregnant 
people, or the elderly.

:::{.quote}
Even though the BMI chart can be inaccurate for certain people, healthcare providers 
still use it \
because it’s the quickest tool for assessing a person’s estimated 
body fat amount.
:::

Ah, so it is used because it is easy to calculate, not because it is particularly
useful or accurate.

A January 2025 article in the medical journal *The Lancet* states [@Rubino2025]

:::{.quote}
Current BMI-based measures of obesity can both underestimate and overestimate
adiposity and provide inadequate information about health at the individual level, 
which undermines medically-sound approaches to health care and policy.
:::

Based on this article, 
[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/bmi-is-bogus-best-way-to-tell-if-youre-a-healthy-weight-2016-9) 
went a step further, calling BMI **bogus**. Having "obesity" according to the 
BMI scale does not mean a person is unhealthy. In fact, BMI does not tell you
anything about the health of a person. 

It is worthwhile to examine how BMI came 
about. The comment above about the increasing height of people suggests that BMI 
was developed some time ago. Indeed. It was invented for an entirely different
reason, to describe a population average man in Western Europe in the 19^th^ century. 

To make this connection we need to introduce Adolphe Quetelet (1796--1847), 
who invented the BMI to quantify a population according to its person's weight. 
It was initially called the *Quetelet index*.
Quetelet was a Belgian astronomer, statistician, and mathematician---not a
medical professional. He studied the distribution of physical attributes
in populations of French and Scottish people. Quetelet determined that the *normal*,
the most representative value of an attribute, is its average. Prior to Quetelet, 
the idea of "norm" and "normality" was associated with carpentry and construction. 
The carpenter square is also called the norm and in normal construction everything
is at right angles. The classical notion of ideal as an unattainable beauty up 
to this time was reflected in great works of art.

Quetelet focused on the middle of the distribution as the
"new normal" and saw *l’homme moyen*, the average man, as the ideal [@GrueHeiberg].

There is no association with health, and there is no association with the individual.
The BMI as developed by Quetelet was supposed to describe the average in a 
population, not obesity of the individual. The population it was intended to 
describe is French and Scottish of the 19^th^ century. Going from there to a
near universal measure of obesity since the 1970s is quite the stretch.

## Types of Data {#sec-data-types}

Data, the result of quantification, can be classified in a number of ways. The
first distinction of quantified variables is by **data type**. 

- **Continuous**: the number of possible values of the variable is not countable. 
Examples are physical measurements such as weight, height, length, pressure, temperature. 

- **Discrete**: the number of possible values is countable. Even if the number 
of possible values is infinite, the variable is still discrete. The number of fish 
caught per day does not have a theoretical upper limit, although it is highly 
unlikely that a weekend warrior will catch 1,000 fish. A commercial fishing vessel 
might.\
\
Discrete variables are further divided into the following groups:
    - **Count Variables**: the values are true counts, obtained by enumeration. 
    There are two types of counts:

        - **Counts per unit**: the count relates to a unit of measurement, e.g., 
        the number of fish caught per day, the number of customer complaints per 
        quarter, the number of chocolate chips per cookie, the number of cancer 
        incidences per 100,000.

        - **Proportions (Counts out of a total)**: the count can be converted 
        to a proportion by dividing it with a maximum value. Examples are the 
        number of heads out of 10 coin tosses, the number of larvae out of 20 
        succumbing to an insecticide,

    - **Categorical Variables**: the values consist of labels, even if numbers 
    are used for labeling.

        - **Nominal variables**: The labels are unordered, for example the 
        variable "fruit" takes on the values "apple", "peach", "tomato" 
        (yes, tomatoes are fruit but do not belong in fruit salad).

        - **Ordinal variables**: the category labels can be arranged in a natural 
        order in a lesser-greater sense. Examples are 1---5 star reviews or ratings 
        of severity ("mild", "modest", "severe").

        - **Binary variables**: take on exactly two values (dead/alive, Yes/No, 
        1/0, fraud/not fraud, diseased/not diseased)

Categorical variables are also called **qualitative** variables. They encode a
quality, namely to belong to one of the categories. All other variables are also
called **quantitative** variables. Note that quantifying something through numbers
does not imply it is a quantitative variable. Highway exits might have numbers that
are simple identifiers not related to distances. The number of stars on a 5-star
rating scale indicates the category, not a quantified amount. The numeric values
of quantitative variables, on the other hand, can be used to calculate meaningful
differences and ratios. 40 kg is twice as much as 20 kg, but a 4-star review is 
not twice as much as a 2-star review---it is simply higher than a 2-star review.

## Uncertainty

When I hop on the scales in the bathroom in the morning, I usually take two or
three measurements in quick succession. They rarely are identical, differing by
a fraction of a pound. Day-to-day variation could be understandable, our weight
does change over time. But second-to-second variation, that seems odd. It seems
unlikely that I gained or lost a quarter pound over the last 5 seconds. 

Quantifying things is associated with **uncertainty** that is introduced through various
forms of **variability**. My weight measurement varies from one measurement to the
next because of my posture, movement on the scales, and the performance of the scales
mechanism itself. Not because my actual weight differs. This type of variability
is called **measurement error**. If we measure the weights of students in a classroom
another source of variability is introduced, subject-to-subject variability. If
we randomly choose a classroom from the school, the measurements also represent
classroom-to-classroom variability, since repeating the process and selecting
a different classroom will yield a different number.

In the presence of uncertainty, quantities are not knowable a priori. But if 
the uncertainty itself can be quantified, then the quantity of interest is
predictable. I am unable to say what the average weight is of a student in a freshman 
class. But by measuring weights and quantifying uncertainty in the observations
I can **predict** with a high level of confidence that the average freshmen 
students' weight is between this much and that much (now attach your favorite 
weight units).

It is one of humanities' great advances that we are not only able to represent
concepts in numbers, but that we can quantify uncertainty itself. Probability
and statistics enable us to learn from uncertain events and measurements. This
adds to our vocabulary of lengths, weights, volumes, five-star ratings, and so on, 
the terms prediction, forecast, likelihood, odds, chance, and probability.

A meteorologist forecasting a 30% chance of rain tomorrow is quantifying the 
likelihood of an event. We all know how to operationalize this forecast. The
higher the number, the more likely we will need an umbrella the next day. 
Interestingly, while we have developed intuition about "the chance of rain", 
many do not know how to correctly interpret a statement such as "30% chance of
rain". It does not mean that 30% of the area covered by the forecast will
see rain. It does not mean that on days like today, 30% of them will have a rain
event. Rather, it means that there is a 0.3 probability that **any** point in the
forecast area will see a measurable amount of rain (usually 0.01 inches or more).

Another interpretation flows from the fact that weather forecasts are based on 
models that simulate weather conditions based on inputs. To account for the 
inherent uncertainty in measuring the inputs, multiple scenarios (simulations)
are run. a 30\% chance of rain means that 30\% of the simulations predicted
rain for the forecast area.

---

By applying statistical principles in the analysis of data uncertainty can be
reduced. More informed insights about the data are then possible. Suppose we 
want to measure the average amount of an attribute in a population---say, the 
average years of postgraduate education. The population is too large to visit
with every member so we instead quiz only a smaller number about their education.
If we randomly sample one person from the population, we get a statistically
valid estimate for the entire population. If they have 2 years of postgraduate
education, our best guess for the average amount of post-graduate education in 
the entire population is 2 years. However, we have not reduced the uncertainty
at all, the single measurement is as uncertain as the variability of postgraduate
education years in the population. Suppose this variability can be quantified 
with the amount $X$. If we repeat the process of randomly sampling persons $n-1$
more times and computing the average across the $n$ measurements---this is called
the **sample average**---we get a much better estimate of the average number
of years of postgraduate education in the population. It turns out that the 
sample average so obtained has uncertainty $X/n$. In other words, we can make 
our statement about the population quantity of interest arbitrarily precise by
sampling a large number of people from the population.
 
For attributes with large variability $X$ it will take a larger sample size $n$
to achieve the same level of precision compared to attributes with less variability.
If the attribute does not vary at all in the population ($X=0$), then a single
sample is sufficient. In the population of apartment renters there is no variability
in the attribute *renter*, but there is variability in the attribute *amount of rent late*.


## Surrogacy {#sec-intro-surrogacy}

A **surrogate** metric (**proxy** metric) is one that is used in the place of another. 
We have seen earlier how economic indicators are used to describe aspects of the economy:

- The consumer price index is a surrogate metric for cost of living and inflation.
- The net promoter score is a surrogate metric for customer loyalty. 

When quantifying a variable of interest is difficult, time consuming, expensive, 
or destructive, and a surrogate variable is easy to quantify, the surrogate can 
take the place of the variable of interest.

Here are some examples of surrogacy:

- **Healthcare** 
    - Cholesterol levels as a proxy for heart health.

- **Education**
    - Standardized test scores as surrogates for student achievement.
    - Graduation rates as a proxy for work force preparation.

- **Manufacturing**
    - Force to pull a nail through a gypsum board as a surrogate for dry wall
    quality.
    
- **Economy** 
    - Gross Domestic Product as a surrogate for societal well-being.
    - Consumer Price Index as a surrogate for purchasing power.
    - Unemployment rate as a surrogate for economic health.

- **Environmental Science**
    - CO2 levels as proxy for climate change.
    - Tree canopy cover as a proxy for biodiversity.

- **Human Resources** 
    - Measuring employee productivity by number of hours worked.
    - Employee attrition as a surrogate for employee satisfaction.

- **Technology**
    - Number of downloads of an app as a measure of market share.
    - Likes and shares as a measure of social media engagement

- **Academia**
    - Citation count as a surrogate for research impact.

Surrogate measurements are very often necessary, but they are not without issues:

- They might not capture all factors influencing the attribute of interest.
- They can lead to oversimplification and misinterpretation.
- The surrogate might not measure what is most relevant. For example, standardized
test scores do not measure critical thinking.
- They can lead to **surrogation**.


### Surrogation

**Surrogation** occurs when people or organizations substitute a metric for the 
underlying concept or goal that the metric is intended to represent. Instead of 
treating the metric as a proxy or tool to measure progress, they treat it as the 
ultimate goal itself. The metric has become the goal. Surrogates are good.
Surrogation is bad.

When standardized test scores are a surrogate for student achievement, surrogation
means to focus on driving up the test scores rather than focusing on driving
actual student achievement. 

Someone can obsess over BMI (body mass index), trying to improve their BMI but not
getting any healthier. 

Surrogation of net promoter scores occurs when 
companies focus on driving up NPS by only asking customers that repeatedly 
buy their product. The goal is to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, the
NPS should increase as a result. Surrogation focuses on the NPS, not the actual
customer satisfaction. The first mistake in surrogation is to assume that the 
surrogate is exactly what it is a proxy for. To assume that the net promoter 
score is a proxy for customer satisfaction it is not customer satisfaction.

Sales people are often incentivized on number of deals or deal volume (revenue).
The underlying goal is to drive success for the company. Surrogation can lead 
to closing of deals that are bad for the company (losing money on the deal) but
work in favor of the sales person's metric to hit a revenue target.

---

When metrics are tied to performance evaluation, resource assignment, advancement, 
surrogation is common. It leads to distorted priorities and bad behavior (gaming
the system): people try to meet the metric without achieving the underlying goal.

Another negative aspect of surrogation is to prioritize the simple fixes and quick wins
instead of the deeper but more expensive and difficult corrections. A hospital
might focus on amenities or quick ER service rather than improving health outcomes
for its patients. A social media content creator generates click bait in order
to increase clicks rather than focusing on meaningful engagement.
