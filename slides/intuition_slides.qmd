# Quantitative Intuition and Problem Solving 

<br/>

:::{.centered}
In this module you are presented with puzzles and problems to flex your \
analytic and quantitative thinking muscles. \
\
Most of these are well-known problems  that you might run into during \
job interviews that test problem-solving skills and analytical thinking.

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
Suppose that Andy and Brie are arrested as members of a criminal gang and held 
separately by the police. They cannot communicate. There is enough evidence to
convict them on a lesser charge, but not on the principal charge. The police
offers the following deal:

- If they both remain silent, they will each serve one year in prison.
- If one testifies against the other, but the other one does not, the one who
testified will be set free while the other serves three years in prison.
- If Andy and Brie both testify against each other, they will each serve two years.

How should Andy and Brie behave to optimize their positions, that is, look out
after their own interest?

## Guarding Criminals 

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
Suppose you are guarding $n$ criminals in an open field. You have one gun with
a single bullet. You are a good shot and being fired at means death---the criminals
know that. Their behavior is governed by the following rules: 

- If any of them has a non-zero probability of surviving, they will attempt to escape.
- If a criminal is certain of death, they will not attempt to escape.

How do you guard the criminals and stop them from escaping?

## Three Jars
:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
Three opaque jars are sitting on a table. The jars are labeled "Apples", "Oranges",
and "Apples & Oranges". Unfortunately, all three are labeled incorrectly.

![](../images/ThreeJars.png){fig-align=center width=30%}

Your task is to assign the labels correctly to the jars. 
What is the smallest number of fruit you have to choose in order to correctly
label the three jars?

## Pattern Recognition \#1

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
@fig-math-puzzle1 shows a logic reasoning puzzle. The first row makes sense if 
the strange operator is addition, but that does not work for the next rows.
You have to find the meaning of that operator, then apply the pattern to solve
the last equation.

![Can you solve this?](../images/LogicPuzzle1.png){#fig-math-puzzle1 width=35%}
:::


## Pattern Recognition \#2

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
Here is a sequence of numbers.

$$
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
11 \\
21 \\
1211 \\
111221 \\
312211 \\
??
\end{array}
$$

What is the next number in the sequence?

## Birthday Problem {.scrollable}

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
This is a classical problem in probability, and a popular one because it is 
relatable yet somewhat counterintuitive. The probability is higher than what 
most people expect. It goes like this: 

>What is the probability that in a group of $n$ randomly chosen people, at least two share the same birthday?

"Birthday" is meant as one of 365 days of the year, not adjusting for leap years.
Also, we are not taking the birth year into account. A birthday for the purpose
of this problem is April 10, or August 15, etc.

The standard version of the problem uses $n=23$, because you can imagine yourself
in a group of that size---a classroom, for example---and the probability of at
least two shared birthdays is also relatable.

How likely do you think at least two people share a birthday in a group of 23?

## Minimum Cuts

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
Imagine that you hire a consultant to work for you for five days. At the end of 
each day you need to pay them 1/5th of a gold bar. You have a single gold bar
(worth 5 fifths) and need to cut it up so you can pay the consultant at the 
end of each day.

![A gold bar that needs to be cut up.](../images/GoldBar.png){#fig-gold-bar fig-align="center" width=25%}

What is the minimum number of cuts that allow you to pay the consultant every day?

## When to Choose the Ticket

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
An airline has a single seat open on a flight, but $n=100$ standby passengers 
hoping to get on the flight. You are one of the passengers on standby.
To be fair to all standby passengers, the airline decides to drop 100 equal-sized
pieces of paper into a bucket. 99 of them are blank, one says "Last Seat".
The papers are folded and shuffled in the bucket.

The standby passengers queue and each passenger gets to pick one piece of paper
without replacement---that is, they keep the slip and do not return it to the 
bucket. Also they cannot unfold and look at the slip until all of them re drawn.
After the last slip is drawn the standby passengers announce who is the lucky 
person that drew the "Last Seat" by checking their slip.

Here is the question: if you have your choice to pick first, second, last, or 
at any particular position in the queue, which position would you choose?

## How Many Squares on a Chessboard

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
A chess board is made up of eight rows and columns of black and white positions
(@fig-chessboard). \
How many squares are on a board?

## Book Sorting {.scrollable}

:::{style="font-size: 0.9em;"}
<br/>
You are working in a library and are sorting books from a box that 
contains 32 fiction (F) and 17 non-fiction (NF) books. A steady supply of new
books is available to add to the box. Your sorting algorithm goes as follows:

- You randomly choose 2 books from the box. 
- Based on the types of books chosen you add another book from the supply to the box:

  1. if you choose two fiction books (F,F) you add a new fiction book to the box
  2. if you choose two non-fiction books (NF, NF) you also add a fiction book to the box
  3. if you choose one fiction and one non-fiction book (F,NF or NF,F) then you add
  a non-fiction book to the box.

Since you add only one book to the box for every two books you remove, the box
will eventually be empty. What is the type of the last book in the box? Is it 
a fiction or a non-fiction book?

## Inverted Triangle

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
@fig-coin-triangle shows a triangle made from 10 coins. Can you change this into
an upside-down triangle by moving only 3 coins?

![Inverting the coin triangle.](../images/CoinTrianglePuzzle.png){#fig-coin-triangle fig-align="center" width=75%}

## The Spare Tire

:::{style="font-size: 1em;"}
<br/>
Your car has four tires mounted to the wheels and a spare tire (S). That gives you
five tires to work with. Each of the tires lasts at most 30,000 miles. If you can 
exchange tires among the five as many times as you wish, what is the furthest 
distance you can travel before you need to purchase a new tire?

@fig-tire-solution1 depicts the initial tire life prior to driving the first mile.
All tires, including the spare (S) have the same life expectancy of 30,000 miles.

## Robot Triangle

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
There are many versions of this basic puzzle, using ants, camels, and other
animals. We use robots here, the puzzle goes like this. \
\
Three robots are placed
at the corners of a triangle. A robot can choose to move along either side of
the triangle that meet at its corner (@fig-robot-triangle). \
\
What is the probability that any two robots will collide?

![Robot triangle.](../images/RobotTrianglePuzzle.png){#fig-robot-triangle fig-align="center" width=35%}
:::


## Truth Telling

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
This puzzle is about logic reasoning and not about probability. Surprisingly,
it is related to the previous robot movement puzzle.

Consider the following three statements:

1. Gavin says that Brian is a liar.
2. Brian says that Jenn is a liar.
3. Jenn says that both Gavin and Brian are liars.

Who is telling the truth and who is lying?

## Clock Made With Matches

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
You have two wooden sticks and a box of matches. When a sticks is lit it 
will burn completely in exactly one hour.\
\
How do you use these ingredients to measure exactly 45 minutes?
:::


## Two Stacks of Cards


:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
You have two stacks of cards. The first is a regular 52-card deck. The 
second stack contains two regular 52-card decks, thus has 104 cards.
Both stacks are shuffled well. You choose two cards in sequence and you win if 
they are both red. \
\
Would you prefer to choose from the 52-card stack or the 104-card stack?

## Rapid Fire

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
Cowboy Billy carries a Colt single action 6 shooter revolver. When he fires all 
6 shots in a row, the time between the first bullet and the last is 60 seconds.\
\
How long would it take him to fire 3 shots?
:::


## Crossing the River

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em;"}
<br/>
A farmer is on his way back from the market, with him he has a fox, a chicken 
and some grain. To get home he needs to cross a river using a small boat that can
accommodate only him and one of the other items. Unfortunately, if the fox is 
left alone with the chicken it will eat it. If the chicken is left alone with 
the grain, it will eat it. \
\
How can the farmer cross the river and bring home the fox, the chicken, and the grain?
