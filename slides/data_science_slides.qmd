# Data Science

:::{.absolute top=150}
:::{.centered}
At the intersection of the foundation disciplines statistics, mathematics, and 
computer science, performing data science means drawing conclusions from data 
about real-world problems using computation and automation in the presence of 
uncertainty.

:::{.absolute top=125}
:::{.centered}
From the 30,000 foot view a model is simply a mechanism to process some input and 
produce a corresponding output.

## Signal and Noise

:::{.incremental .highlight-last}
* [Models Separate Signal and Noise]{.maroon}
<br/>**Signal**: Systematic, non-random effects in the data
<br/>**Noise**: Unpredictable randomness around the signal  


* [Intelligence Analysis]{.maroon}
<br/>**Signal**: Information we are trying to find
<br/>**Noise**: Cacophony of other information that obscures the signal
<br/>Noise can be a signal for something else but is irrelevant for 
what we are trying to predict
<br/>Note: hindsight is 20:20

## Supervised Learning

* [Most important type of learning from data]{.maroon}

* [Named after analogy to teacher in classroom]{.maroon}
<br/>The teacher asks students questions
<br/>The teacher knows the correct answer
<br/>Measures quality of the answer 
<br/>We do not want students to memorize answers
<br/>We want them to become problem solvers, applying learned knowledge to new problems:
**generalization**.

## Supervised Learning and Data Science Models

:::{.incremental}
* [Target Variable]{.maroon}
<br/>Other names: dependent variable, response variable, output variable
<br/>The attribute we wish to draw conclusions about
<br/>Its values represent the correct answers we train the model on  

* [Input variables]{.maroon}
<br/>Other names: independent variables, factors, regressors
<br/>They should be somehow related to the target variable
<br/>Relationships are used to construct a mathematical representation

* [Learning and Teaching]{.maroon}
<br/> The problems asked by the teacher, the learning algorithm, are the data points.
<br/> The values of the target variable are the the correct answers. 
<br/> The input variables represent the information used by the students to answer the 
questions. 
<br/> During training, the algorithm makes the connection between input variables and target variable
<br/> Later we can apply the trained algorithm to new observations for
which the label (the true value) is unknown.

::::{.assignment-header}
Nail Pull Test for Drywall
::::
::::{.assignment-container}
The quality of drywall is measured with a **nail pull test**. A standard fastener is
pulled through the entire wall, including the nail's head. The reported value for 
Nail Pull Resistance is the maximum stress achieved while the head penetrates through 
the board surface and core.

- What is the target variable of a model for the nail pull test?
- What are potential input variables of the model?
- What are the benefits of deriving a data science model for the nail pull test?

## Labeling

* The values of the target variable are also called the **labels** in machine learning. 

* Name stems from image analysis: prior to training human interpreters label the content of images

![](../images/image_labeling.webp){fig-align="center" width=60%}


## Supervised Learning Goals. 

<br/>

-   Predict the target variable from input variables.

-   Develop a function that approximates the underlying relationship between inputs and outputs.

-   Understand the relationship between inputs and outputs.

-   Classify observations into categories of the target variable based on the input variables.

-   Group the observations into sets of similar data based on the values of the target variable and based on values of the inputs.

-   Reduce the dimensionality of the problem by transforming target and inputs from a high-dimensional to a lower-dimensional space.

-   Test hypotheses about the target variable.

## Generalization

<br/>

:::{.centered}
Our teacher has the noble goal of not just drilling the correct answers but to
turn the students into problem solvers who can apply concepts to solve new
questions. \
\
What is the parallel of this concept in supervised machine learning?
:::

<br/>

* Need to test how well the model works for new data points

* Want to get great answers (predictions, classifications, forecasts) on 
previously unseen data 

* Avoid **overfitting**: building models that follow the training data too closely

* Avoid **underfitting**: building models that are too simple

* This is known as the **bias--variance** tradeoff in data science

Compartmental Models in Epidemiology
::::
::::{.assignment-container style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
The SIR (Susceptible--Infectious--Recovered) model is a standard model in 
epidemiology. It describes how an infectious disease moves through a population. 
At each point in time an individual is in one of three states, called **compartments**: 

* **S**: You have not had the disease but you are **susceptible** to it
* **I**: You are **infected** by the disease
* **R**: You are **recovered** from the disease, or dead 

Assumptions of the SIR model:

* The disease progresses in only one direction, from S to I to R. 
* Everyone is equally susceptible and behaves the same way.
* Everyone is equally likely to be vaccinated, if a vaccine is available.
* All members of the populations intermingle at random.

---

1. What does vaccination look like in terms of s SIR model?
2. Do the SIR model assumptions invalidate the model for some diseases and
circumstances?
3. Does the SIR model apply to the COVID-19 pandemic?

## Assignment

::::{.assignment-header}
Reproduction Number $R_0$ Epidemiology
::::
::::{.assignment-container}
The rate at which a disease spreads through the population is measured by the
**basic reproduction** number, $R_0$. This number, which we became all too 
familiar with during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures the number of uninfected 
people expected to catch the disease from an infected individual. 

An $R_0$ of
3 means that someone who contracts the disease is expected to pass it on to three
other individuals. In the absence of vaccines or quarantines, any disease with
$R_0 > 1$ will eventually spread to the entire population.

- Discuss whether the assumptions of the SIR model apply to the COVID-19 pandemic.

- What could be reasons why epidemiologists hold on to a SIR model even if one 
or more of its assumptions are violated?

- In some countries COVID intervention measures were directly related to $R_0$,
often called the R-number. Depending on whether a multi-day average of $R_0$ was above
or below a threshold COVID restrictions were more severe or relaxed.
$R_0$ is calculated either retrospectively from epidemiological data (such as data from contact 
tracing) or using theoretical mathematical models based on differential equations
such as the SIR model. Discuss the pros and cons of the two approaches.

- Is $R_0$ a biological constant of a pathogen, or is it a function of human
behavior **and** characteristics of the pathogen?

Modeling Coin Flips
::::
::::{.assignment-container}
Goal: predict whether a coin, when flipped, lands on Heads or Tails.

Approach 1: Develop a mathematical model that captures the forces acting on
the coin

- What are the inputs you consider for this model?
- Are you building one big model or a combination of sub-models?
- What are assumptions you are making? 

Approach 2: Develop a stochastic model to predict coin flips.

- What are the assumptions of this model?
- What are the unknowns (parameters) in the model?
- What sort of statements will you be able to make about a particular coin?
- How would you establish whether a given coin is fair (heads and tails equally likely)?
