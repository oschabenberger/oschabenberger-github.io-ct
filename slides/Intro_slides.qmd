# Computational Thinking (CT)
<br/>

:::{.centered}
**Computational thinking** (CT) is a problem-solving methodology
that develops solutions for complex problems by breaking them down into individual
steps.
:::

## Elements of Computational Thinking {.incremental}

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-  [Problem Definition]{.maroon}
<br/>What problem are we solving?

- [Decomposition (Factoring)]{.maroon}
<br/>Break problem into smaller parts

- [Pattern Recognition]{.maroon}
<br/>Learn connections and relationships

- [Generalization]{.maroon}
<br/>See relevant details

- [Algorithm Design]{.maroon}
<br/>Step by step repeatable instructions
:::

## Step 1. Problem Definition 

- [What problem are we solving?]{.maroon}

Difference between solving a problem and building a solution looking for a problem.

![Benz Patent-Motorwagen, the first automobile.](../images/FirstAutomobile.png){#fig-benz width=30%}

## Step 2. Decomposition (Factoring) {.scrollable}

- [Break a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts]{.maroon} 
- [Focus the solution on the aspects that matter]{.maroon}
- [Eliminate extraneous stuff]{.maroon}

. . .

![Decompose a bicycle.](../slides_images/Bicycle.jpeg){#fig-bicycle width=50%}

::: {.incremental}
- Frame, seat, handle bars, chain, pedals, crank, derailleurs, brakes, etc. 
:::

## Step 3. Pattern Recognition

- Learning connections and relationships between the parts of the problem. 
- Bicycle: front and rear derailleurs work together to change gears.

. . .

- [Can you solve this like 10 yr old Carl Friedrich?]{.maroon}

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{100} i = ??
$$
:::

:::{.column width=25%}
![Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777--1855)](../slides_images/CarlFriedrichGauss.jpg){#fig-cfg width=50%}
:::
::::

Gauss immediately recognized the solution was 5,050. How did he do it?

. . .

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{100} i = (1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + ... + (50 + 51) = 5,050
$$

There are 50 partial sums, each has a value of 101. 50 x 101 = 5,050.


## Step 4. Generalization (Abstraction) {.scrollable}

- [Seeing relevant details of the problem]{.maroon}
<br/>How are we going about solving it?
<br/>What are the **rules**, what is the core logic?

- [Examples]{.maroon}
    - Software to solve jigsaw puzzle
    - Decomposing a rectangle into squares to compute area (@fig-rectangle-decomp).

![Decomposing a 12 x 8 rectangle into six 4 x 4 squares to generalize computation of the area](../images/RectangleDecomposition.png){#fig-rectangle-decomp fig-align="center" width=25%}


## Step 5. Algorithm Design

- [Algorithmic thinking]{.maroon}

<br/>Solution is as a series of repeatable step-by-step instructions. 
<br/>Does not mean the solution has to be implemented by a computer.

## Making Pumpkin Soup {.scrollable .smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Problem

We have a hankering for pumpkin soup. 

We have ingredients and a stove but have never prepared this kind of soup before.

### Decomposition

What are the manageable parts of the problem?

- [Ingredients]{.maroon}: Identify the key ingredients required for the soup.
<br/>
  Pumpkin\
  Onion or Leek\
  Garlic\
  Stock (vegetable or chicken)\
  Cream (optional)\
  Salt, pepper, and spices (e.g., nutmeg, cinnamon)\
  Olive oil or butter for sautéing

- [Preparation]{.maroon}: Break down the actions involved in preparing the ingredients.
  Peel and chop the pumpkin\
  Chop the onion and garlic\
  Prepare spices and seasoning

- [Cooking]{.maroon}: Identify the steps in cooking the soup.
  Sauté the onion and garlic\
  Add the pumpkin and cook it\
  Add stock and bring to a simmer\
  Puree the mixture\
  Add cream and season to taste\

- [Final Steps]{.maroon}: Focus on finishing touches.
  Garnish (optional)\
  Serve and taste for seasoning adjustments

### Pattern

What are the similar elements or repeating steps in the problem?

- [Common cooking steps]{.maroon}
<br/>Many soups follow a similar structure: sautéing vegetables, 
adding liquid, simmering, and then blending or pureeing.

- [Ingredient variations]{.maroon}
<br/>While the exact ingredients for pumpkin soup may vary 
(e.g., adding coconut milk instead of cream), the basic framework of the recipe 
remains the same.

- [Timing patterns]{.maroon}
<br/>There’s a pattern to the cooking times: first sautéing for 
a few minutes, then simmering the soup for about 20-30 minutes, followed by blending.

### Generalization

We can generalize (abstract) the process of making pumpkin soup into a more 
general recipe for making any pureed vegetable soup, regardless of the specific
ingredients.

- [Essential components]{.maroon}\
  A base (onions, garlic, or other aromatics)\
  A main vegetable (in this case, pumpkin)\
  Liquid (stock, broth, or water)\
  Seasoning and optional cream

- [General process]{.maroon}
  1. Sauté aromatics.
  2. Add the main vegetable and liquid.
  3. Simmer until the vegetable is tender.
  4. Blend until smooth.
  5. Adjust seasoning and add cream if desired.

### Algorithm

The step-by-step instructions

1. [Prepare ingredients]{.orange}\
   Peel and chop the pumpkin into cubes.\
   Chop the onion and garlic.
   
2. [Sauté aromatics]{.orange}\
   In a pot, heat oil or butter over medium heat.\
   Add chopped onion and garlic, sauté for 5 minutes until softened.

3. [Cook pumpkin]{.orange}\
   Add chopped pumpkin to the pot and sauté for 5 minutes.\
   Add stock to cover the pumpkin (about 4 cups) and bring to a boil.

4. [Simmer]{.orange}\
   Lower the heat, cover, and let the soup simmer for 20-30 minutes until the 
   pumpkin is tender.

5. [Blend the soup]{.orange}\
   Use an immersion blender or transfer the soup to a blender. Puree until smooth.

6. [Add cream and seasoning]{.orange}\
   Stir in cream (optional) and season with salt, pepper, and spices to taste 
   (e.g., nutmeg or cinnamon).

7. [Serve]{.orange}\
   Pour into bowls and garnish with optional toppings (e.g., a swirl of cream, 
   roasted seeds, or fresh herbs).

## Importance of CT {#sec-intro-ct-importance}

- [Computational Thinking in any domain]{.maroon}
<br/>An effective way of problem solving
<br/>More problems today solved through software and computing  

- [Proliferation of models]{.maroon}
<br/>Abstractions by nature
<br/>Implementation involves design of computer algorithms  

- [Examples]{.maroon}
<br/>Financial analysts make investment decisions based on models of market behavior. 
<br/>Banks decide whether to award a loan based on modeling the probability of loan default. 
<br/>Insurance premiums are based on risk models. 
<br/>Physician chooses treatment based on medical knowledge and models that describe patient outcomes.

# Quantitative Thinking (QT)
</br>

:::{.centered}
**Quantitative Thinking** is a problem-solving technique that views the world 
through measurable events, and approaches problems by analyzing quantitative evidence. 

At the heart of QT lies **quantification**,
representing things in measurable quantities. 

The word quantification is rooted in the Latin word *quantus*, meaning "how much". 
:::

<br/>
The [purpose]{style="color: Maroon; font-weight: bold;"} of quantification is to express things in numbers. 

The [result]{style="color: Maroon; font-weight: bold;"} is data in its many forms.


## Easy/Difficult To Quantify

- [Easy to Quantify]{.maroon}

    - Attributes that are inherently measurable (height, weight, volume, length, ...)
    - Things that can be counted 
    - Variables that can be classified in few categories (alive/dead, employed/unemployed)

    - There are still lots of wrinkles 
 
        - Units of measurement (metric grams vs U.S. Customary ounces )
        - Metric pound is not the same as U.S. Customary pound
        - Apothecary pound is 12 ounces rather than 16 ounces  

. . .

- [Difficult to Quantify]{.maroon}

    - Attributes that escape precise measurements (happiness)
    - Difficult to define (trust)
    - Inconsistent views, context-dependent
    - Subjective attributes (introversion)
    - Abstract concepts (individualism)

 
## Difficult to Quantify {.scrollable}
 
 - [Personal and Psychological Attributes]{.maroon}\
 **Emotions**: Happiness, anxiety, sadness\
 **Traits**: Introversion, openness\
 **Other examples**:  
 
 . . .
 
 - [Social and Cultural Variables]{.maroon}\
 **Social Norms**: expectations about behavior\
 **Trust**\
 **Cultural Values**: individualism, freedom\
 **Other examples**:  
 
 . . .
 
 - [Ethics and Morality]{.maroon}\
 **Fairness**\
 **Integrity**\
 **Justice**  
 
 . . .
 
 - [Economic and Market Variables]{.maroon}\
 **Brand loyalty**\
 **Customer satisfaction**\
 **Economic health**\
 **Other examples**:  
 
 . . .
 
 - [Environmental and Ecological Factors]{.maroon}\
 **Biodiversity**\
 **Ecosystem health**\
 **Natural beauty**\
 **Recreational value**\
 **Other examples**:  
 
## Example {.scrollable}
 
:::{.example}
::::{.example-header}
Net Promoter Score (NPS): Are my customers satisfied and are they loyal?
::::
::::{.example-container}
NPS is considered by many **the gold standard** customer experience metric.
It rests on a single question:\

:::{.maroonc}
"How likely are you to recommend the company products or services?"
:::

NPS calculation (@fig-nps):

- Response on a scale of 0–10 (0 = not at all likely to recommend, 10 = extremely likely to recommend).
- Respondents are categorized as promoters (9--10), passives (7--8), or 
detractors (0--6).
- NPS = %Promoters - %Detractors

## Exercise

:::{.assignment}
::::{.assignment-header}
Net Promoter Score
::::
::::{.assignment-container}
1. What are the assumptions in the NPS calculation?
2. Company Foo improved its NPS from 30 to 40 over the last year. Explain how
that can happen.
3. What does NPS tell you about a company that has many products and/or services?
4. What impact could cultural differences and societal norms and traditions have
on NPS values around the world?
5. What do you think is a great net promoter score? Does it depend on the industry?
6. Companies are applying NPS in other contexts, not just to measure
customer satisfaction. For example, the employee NPS (eNPS) uses NPS methodology
and the question "How likely are you to recommend company X as a place of work?" 
What do you think about that?
7. If you plot NPS by age, what would that look like? In other words, do you expect
younger or older consumers to have higher/lower NPS?

8. List reasons why NPS is (might be) a troubling indicator.

::::{.assignment-container}
Read the section *Measuring and Explaining National Differences in Life Evaluations*
in the [2024 World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2024/happiness-of-the-younger-the-older-and-those-in-between)

- Which variables is the ranking of happiness based on?
- How many citizens of each country participate in the survey?
- Does WHR collect its own data or does it rely on someone else's survey?
- The data includes three indicators for well-being. Are they all used in 
determining the happiness rankings?
- In the discussion of the methods, can you determine whether the happiness 
rankings involve some form of modeling, where survey responses are tied to 
other variables? If so, what are the variables? Are these reflected in Table 2.1?

## Indicators

- When dealing with complex systems that depend on many factors

- Cannot capture the system in a single number

- We use indicators to capture parts of the system

- **Leading indicator**: predictive, informing us about what
might happen in the future. 

- **Lagging indicator**: descriptive, it looks at what has happened in the past.

## Exercise

:::{.assignment}
::::{.assignment-header}
Quantifying the Economy
::::
::::{.assignment-container}
Find at least two indicators in each of the following aspects:

1. International trade
2. Housing and construction
3. Consumer spending
4. Manufacturing
5. Climate
6. Labor markets

What are the indicators used for--that is, what do they indicate?

Which indicators are lagging, which are leading?

## Surrogates {.scrollable}

Instead of measuring an attribute directly, we use surrogates to infer a 
difficult-to-measure attribute.

- [Education]{.maroon}
    - Standardized test scores as surrogates for student achievement.
    - Graduation rates as a proxy for work force preparation.

- [Economy]{.maroon}
    - Gross domestic product as a surrogate for societal well-being.
    - Unemployment rate as a surrogate for economic health

- [Environmental science]{.maroon}
    - CO2 levels as proxy for climate change.
    - Tree canopy cover as a proxy for biodiversity.

- [Employment]{.maroon}
    - Number of hours worked to measure employee productivity
    - Attrition rate as a measure of employee satisfaction

- [Technology]{.maroon}
    - Number of downloads of an app as a measure of market share.
    - Likes and shares as a measure of social media engagement

- [Academia]{.maroon}
    - Citation count as a surrogate for research impact. 


## Issues with Surrogates

- They might not capture all factors influencing the attribute of interest.

- They can lead to oversimplification and misinterpretation.

- The surrogate might not measure what is most relevant. For example, standardized
test scores do not measure critical thinking.

- [Can lead to surrogation]{.maroon}
<br/>**Surrogation** occurs when people or organizations substitute a metric for the 
underlying concept or goal that the metric is intended to represent. Instead of 
treating the metric as a proxy or tool to measure progress, they treat it as the 
ultimate goal itself. The metric has become the goal.

- [Examples of surrogation]{.maroon}
    - Standardized test scores are a surrogate for student achievement, surrogation
means to focus on driving up the test scores rather than focusing on driving
actual student achievement.  
    - Surrogation of net promoter scores occurs when 
companies focus on driving up NPS by only asking customers who repeatedly 
buy their product
    - Sales people are incentivized on number of deals or deal volume (revenue).
The real goal is to drive success for the company. The incentives lead to deals
that are good for the sales people ("making their number") and bad for the company.

## Types of Data

- [Continuous]{.maroon}\
The number of possible values of the variable is not countable. \
Examples: physical measurements such as weight, height, length, pressure, temperature. 

- [Discrete]{.maroon}\
The number of possible values is countable, even if infinite.

    - Count Variables
    
    - Categorical Variables\
     also called **qualitative** variables
    
## Discrete Variables

- [Count Variables]{.maroon}
<br/>The values are true counts, obtained by enumeration. There are two types of counts:

    - **Counts per unit**\
    The count relates to a unit of measurement, e.g., 
    the number of fish caught per day, the number of customer complaints per 
    quarter, the number of chocolate chips per cookie, the number of cancer 
    incidences per 100,000.

    - **Proportions (Counts out of a total)**\
    The count can be converted to a proportion by dividing it with a maximum value. 
    Examples are the number of heads out of 10 coin tosses, the number of rats
    out of 20 developing cancer.

- [Categorical Variables]{.maroon}
<br/>The values consist of **labels**, even if numbers are used for labeling.

    - **Nominal variables**\
    The labels are unordered, for example the 
    variable "fruit" takes on the values "apple", "peach", "tomato" 
    (yes, tomatoes are fruit but do not belong in fruit salad).

    - **Ordinal variables**\
    The category labels can be arranged in a natural 
    order in a lesser-greater sense. Examples are 1---5 star reviews or ratings 
    of severity ("mild", "modest", "severe").

    - **Binary variables**\
    Take on exactly two values (dead/alive, Yes/No, 1/0, fraud/not fraud, 
    diseased/not diseased)
