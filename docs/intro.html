<p>In the broad sense, <strong>computational thinking</strong> (CT) is a problem-solving methodology that develops solutions for complex problems by breaking them down into individual steps. Well, are not most problems solved this way? Actually, yes. We all apply computational thinking methodology every day. As we will see in the example below, cooking a pot of soup involves computational thinking.</p>
<p>In the narrow sense, computational thinking is problem solving by expressing the solution in such a way that it can be implemented through a computer—using software and hardware. The term <em>computational</em> in CT derives from the fact that the methodology is based on core principles of computer science. It does not mean that all CT problems are solved through coding. It means to solve problems by thinking like a computer scientists.</p>

<p>This should go without saying, before attempting to build a solution one should know what problem the solution solves. However, we often get things backwards, building solutions first and then looking for what problems to solve with them. The world of technology is littered with solutions looking for a problem.</p>

<p>Solutions looking for problems are commonplace. If someone is trying to sell you a new car when there is nothing wrong with your current car, they (salesman) have a solution (new car) but there is no problem (new car is not needed). So they might try to create a problem by selling you on the benefits of the new model.</p>
<p>On the other hand it is good to innovate and create new solutions even if not all problems the innovation solves are known beforehand. When Karl Benz combined in 1885 a one-cylinder internal combustion engine with a carriage (<a href="#fig-firstcar" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.1</span></a>), he created the first automobile, the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. He probably did not imagine the many future applications of the technology.</p>

<section id="decomposition-factoring" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decomposition-factoring">Decomposition (Factoring)</h4>
<p>This element of computational thinking ask to break the complex problem into smaller, manageable parts and by doing so helps to focus the solution on the aspects that matter, eliminating extraneous stuff.</p>
<p>Smaller problems are easier to solve and can be managed independently. A software developer decomposes a task into several functions, for example, one that takes user input, one that sorts data, one that displays results. These functions can be developed separately and are then combined to produce the solution. Sorting can further be decomposed into subproblems, for example, the choice of data structure (list, tree, etc.), the sort algorithm (heap, quicksort, bubble, …) and so on.</p>
<p>To understand how something works we can factor it into its parts and study how the individual parts work by themselves. A better understanding of the whole results when we reassemble the components we now understand. For example, to figure out how a bicycle works, decompose it into the frame, seat, handle bars, chain, pedals, crank, derailleurs, brakes, etc.</p>
</section>
<section id="pattern-recognition" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pattern-recognition">Pattern recognition</h4>
<p>Pattern recognition is the process of learning connections and relationships between the parts of the problem. In the bicycle example, once we understand the front and rear derailleurs, we understand how they work together in changing gears. Pattern recognition helps to simplify the problem beyond the decomposition by identifying details that are similar or different.</p>

Carl Friedrich Gauss
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) was one of the greatest thinkers of his time and widely considered one of the greatest mathematicians and scientists of all time. Many disciplines, from astronomy, geodesy, mathematics, statistics, and physics list Gauss as a foundational and major contributor.</p>
<p>In <em>The Prince of Mathematics</em>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Tent2006">Tent (<a href="references.html#ref-Tent2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> tells the story of an arithmetic assignment at the beginning of Gauss’ third school year in Brunswick, Germany. Carl was ten years old at the time. Herr Büttner, the teacher wanted to keep the kids quiet for a while and asked them to find the sum of the first 100 integers, <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^{100}i
\]</span> The students were to work the answer out on their slates and place them on Herr Büttner’s desk when done. Carl thought about the problem for a minute, wrote one number on his slate and placed it on the teacher’s desk. He was the first to turn in a solution and it took his classmates much longer. The slates were placed on top of the previous solutions as students finished. Many of them got the answer wrong, messing up an addition somewhere along the way. Herr Büttner, going through the slates one by one found one wrong answer after another and expected Gauss’ answer also to be wrong, since the boy had come up with it almost instantly. To his surprise–or dismay–Gauss’ slate showed no work, Carl had written on it just one number, 5,050, the correct answer.</p>
<p>Carl explained</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Well, sir, I thought about it. I realized that those numbers were all in a row, that they were consecutive, so I figured there must be some pattern. So I added the first and the last number: 1 + 100 = 101. Then I added the second and the next to last numbers: 2 + 99 = 101. […] That meant I would find 50 pairs of numbers that always add up to 101, so the whole sum must be 50 x 101 = 5,050</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carl had recognized a pattern that helped him see the connected parts of the problem: a fixed number of partial sums of the same value.</p>

<section id="generalization-abstraction" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generalization-abstraction">Generalization (Abstraction)</h4>
<p>Once the problem is decomposed and the patterns are recognized, we should be able to see the relevant details of the problem and how we go about solving the problem. This is where we derive the core logic of the solution, the <strong>rules</strong>. For example, to write a computer program to solve a jigsaw puzzle, you would not want to write code specific to one particular puzzle image. You want code that can solve jigsaw puzzles in general. The specific image someone will use for the jigsaw puzzle is an irrelevant detail.</p>
<p>A rectangle can be decomposed into a series of squares (<a href="#fig-rectangle-decomp" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.2</span></a>). Calculating the area of a rectangle as width x height is a generalization of the rule to calculate the area of a square as width-squared.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="algorithm-design">Algorithm design</h4>
<p>The final element of CT involves another form of thinking, <strong>algorithmic thinking</strong>. Here we define the solution as a series of steps to be executed. Algorithmic thinking does not mean the solution has to be implemented by a computer, although this is the case in the narrow sense of CT. The point of the algorithm is to arrive at a set of repeatable, step-by-step instructions, whether these are implemented by humans, machines, or a computer.

<p>Let’s apply the elements of computational thinking to the problem of making pumpkin soup.</p>
<section id="decomposition" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decomposition">Decomposition</h4>
<p>Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. In the case of making pumpkin soup, we can break it down into several steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Identify the key ingredients required for the soup.
<ul>
<li>Pumpkin</li>
<li>Onion or Leek</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Stock (vegetable or chicken)</li>
<li>Cream (optional)</li>
<li>Salt, pepper, and spices (e.g., nutmeg, cinnamon)</li>
<li>Olive oil or butter for sautéing</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Preparation</strong>: Break down the actions involved in preparing the ingredients.
<ul>
<li>Peel and chop the pumpkin</li>
<li>Chop the onion and garlic</li>
<li>Prepare spices and seasoning</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cooking</strong>: Identify the steps in cooking the soup.
<ul>
<li>Sauté the onion and garlic</li>
<li>Add the pumpkin and cook it</li>
<li>Add stock and bring to a simmer</li>
<li>Puree the mixture</li>
<li>Add cream and season to taste</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Final Steps</strong>: Focus on finishing touches.
<ul>
<li>Garnish (optional)</li>
<li>Serve and taste for seasoning adjustments</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pattern-recognition-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pattern-recognition-1">Pattern recognition</h4>
<p>What are the similar elements or repeating steps in the problem?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common cooking steps</strong>: Many soups follow a similar structure: sautéing vegetables, adding liquid, simmering, and then blending or pureeing.</li>
<li><strong>Ingredient variations</strong>: While the exact ingredients for pumpkin soup may vary (e.g., adding coconut milk instead of cream), the basic framework of the recipe remains the same.</li>
<li><strong>Timing patterns</strong>: There’s a pattern to the cooking times: first sautéing for a few minutes, then simmering the soup for about 20-30 minutes, followed by blending.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="generalization" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generalization">Generalization</h4>
<p>We can generalize (abstract) the process of making pumpkin soup into a more general recipe for making any pureed vegetable soup, regardless of the specific ingredients.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essential components</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A base (onions, garlic, or other aromatics)</li>
<li>A main vegetable (in this case, pumpkin)</li>
<li>Liquid (stock, broth, or water)</li>
<li>Seasoning and optional cream</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>General process</strong>:
<ol type="1">
<li>Sauté aromatics.</li>
<li>Add the main vegetable and liquid.</li>
<li>Simmer until the vegetable is tender.</li>
<li>Blend until smooth.</li>
<li>Adjust seasoning and add cream if desired.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="algorithm-design-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="algorithm-design-1">Algorithm design</h4>
<p>Here is a simple algorithm for making pumpkin soup:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Prepare ingredients</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Peel and chop the pumpkin into cubes.</li>
<li>Chop the onion and garlic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sauté aromatics</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In a pot, heat oil or butter over medium heat.</li>
<li>Add chopped onion and garlic, sauté for 5 minutes until softened.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cook pumpkin</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Add chopped pumpkin to the pot and sauté for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add stock to cover the pumpkin (about 4 cups) and bring to a boil.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Simmer</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Lower the heat, cover, and let the soup simmer for 20-30 minutes until the pumpkin is tender.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Blend the soup</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Use an immersion blender or transfer the soup to a blender. Puree until smooth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Add cream and seasoning</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Stir in cream (optional) and season with salt, pepper, and spices to taste (e.g., nutmeg or cinnamon).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Serve</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Pour into bowls and garnish with optional toppings (e.g., a swirl of cream, roasted seeds, or fresh herbs).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#fig-soup-recipe" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.3</span></a> is a specific implementation of the algorithm.</p>
<p>By applying computational thinking, we decomposed the task of making pumpkin soup into smaller steps, recognized patterns in the cooking process, abstracted the general process for making soups, and designed an algorithm to efficiently make pumpkin soup. This method helps streamline the cooking process, ensures nothing is overlooked and provides a clear, repeatable procedure.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-intro-ct-importance">Importance of CT</h3>
<p>Computational thinking as a methodology is applied nowadays in almost any domain and to many problems. Decomposing a problem into parts, recognizing patterns, abstracting the problem essentials and capturing them in an algorithm is an effective approach to deal with many problems.</p>
<p>The rise of computational thinking is also due to the fact that many more problems are solved through software and computing today than in the past. We have become very good at capturing the essential details of processes and phenomena through <strong>models</strong>, which by their very nature are abstractions of the prevailing patterns in those processes. And the implementation of the models frequently involves the design and deployment of algorithms.</p>
<p>Financial analysts make investment decisions based on mathematical models of market behavior. Banks decide whether to award a loan based on statistical models for the probability of loan default. Insurance premiums are based on risk models. A healthcare provider chooses a treatment plan based on assessment of risk factors and predictions of disease progression, based on medical knowledge and models that describe patient outcomes.</p>

<p>While software implementations of problem solving have upended many industries, the way we build and use software, and the types of problems we can solve with it, is itself being upended, thanks to the advances in large-language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others.</p>
<p>The shift toward computational thinking and the importance of solving problems through software has become most evident in 2024, when Nobel prizes in Physics and Chemistry were awarded not to scientists in those fields, but to computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers who developed the foundational computational methods that helped to advance Physics and Chemistry (<a href="#fig-nobel-physics" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.4</span></a> and <a href="#fig-nobel-chemistry" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.5</span></a>).</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-intro-qt"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Quantitative Thinking (QT)</h2>
<p><strong>Quantitative thinking</strong> (QT) is a problem-solving technique, like computational thinking. It views the world through measurable events, and approaches problems by analyzing quantitative evidence. At the heart of QT lies <strong>quantification</strong>, representing things in measurable quantities. The word quantification is rooted in the Latin word <em>quantus</em>, meaning “how much”. The purpose of quantification is to express things in numbers. The result is data in its many forms.</p>
<p>When dealing with inherently measurable attributes such as height or weight, quantification is simple. We need an agreed-upon method of measuring and a system to express the measurement in. The former might be an electronic scale or an analog scale with counterweights for weight measurement, a ruler, yardstick, or laser device for height measurements. It seems obvious to report weights in metric units of milligrams, grams, pounds (500 grams), kilograms, and tons or in U.S. Customary units of ounces, pounds (16 ounces), and tons. As long as we know which measurement units apply, we can all agree on how heavy something is. And we need to keep in mind that the same word can represent different things: a metric pound is 500 grams, a U.S. pound is 453.6 grams. But wait, there is more: Apothecaries’ weights are slightly different, a pound a.p. is 12 ounces. And in some fields, weights are measured entirely differently, diamonds are measured in carats (0.2 grams). In the International System of Units (SI), weight is measured in Newtons, which is gravitational force on a mass, equivalent to kg * m /s<sup>2</sup>. As long as we know what units are used to report a weight, we can convert it into whatever system we want to use. So we could say that this attribute is easily quantifiable.</p>
<p>Other attributes are difficult to quantify. How do you measure happiness? Finland has been declared the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0hmcc91/why-is-finland-the-happiest-country-in-the-world-">happiest country</a> on earth for seven years running. This must involve some form of quantification otherwise we could not rank countries and declare one as “best”. How did they come up with that? The purpose of the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/social-environments-for-world-happiness/">World Happiness Report</a> is to review the science of measuring well-being and to use survey measures of life satisfaction across 150 countries. <em>Happiness</em> according to the World Happiness Report is a combination of many other measurements. For example, a rating of one’s overall life satisfaction, the ability to own a home, the availability of public transportation, etc. Clearly, there is a subjective element in choosing the measurable attributes that are supposed to allow inference about the difficult to measure attribute <em>happiness</em>. Not all attributes weigh equally in the determination of happiness, the weighing scheme itself is part of the quantification. Norms and values also must play a role. The availability of public transportation affects quality of life differently in rural Arkansas and in downtown London. In short, the process of quantifying a difficult-to-measure attribute should be part of the conversation.</p>
<p>This is a common problem in the social sciences: what we are interested in measuring is difficult to quantify and the process of quantification is full of assumptions. Instead of getting at the phenomenon directly, we use other quantities to inform about all or parts of what we are really interested in. These <strong>surrogates</strong> are known by different names: we call them an indicator, an index (such as the consumer price index), a metric, a score, and so on.</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="example-header">
<p>Example: Net Promoter Score (NPS)</p>
</div>
<div class="example-container">
<p>Building on the theme of “happiness”, a frequent question asked by companies that sell products or services is “are my customers satisfied and are they loyal?”</p>
<p>Rather than an extensive survey with many questions as in the World Happiness Report, the question of customer satisfaction and loyalty is often distilled into a single metric in the business world, the Net Promoter Score (NPS). NPS is considered by many the gold standard customer experience metric. It rests on a single question: “How likely are you to recommend the companies products or services?”</p>
<p>The calculation of NPS is as follows (<a href="#fig-nps" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.6</span></a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers answer the question on a scale of 0–10, with 0 being not at all likely to recommend and 10 being extremely likely to recommend.</li>
<li>Based on their response, customers are categorized as promoters, passives, or detractors. A detractor is someone whose answer was between 0 and 6. A promoter is someone whose answer is 9 or 10. The others, which responded with a 7 or 8 are passives.</li>
<li>The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NPS ranges from -100 to 100, higher scores imply more promoters. A NPS of 100 is achieved if everyone scores 9 or 10. A score of -100 is achieved if everyone scores 6 or below.</p>

Important: cultural differences, someone cannot be detractor and promoter at the
same time, division of range is arbitrary, tries to distill a complex relationship
in a single number, depends on how and who you ask among the customers.

Whether you recommend something or detract from something depends on who you
are talking to. You might recommend a product to a peer but not to your parents.

Fewer than those designated as promoters have actually promoted the brand.
It measures intention, not behavior

NPS does not explain why someone would recommend a product: ease of use,
price, customer service, availability, ... It also does not explain why someone
detracts from a product. How are you going to fix things?

<p>The NPS has many detractors, pun intended. Some describe it as “management snake oil”. Management touts it when the NPS goes up, nobody reports it when it goes down.

<section id="indicators" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="indicators">Indicators</h3>
<p>An indicator is a quantitative or qualitative factor or variable that offers a direct, simple, unique and reliable signal or means to measure achievements.</p>
<p>The economy is a complex system for the distribution of goods and services. Such a complex system defies quantification by a single number. Instead, we use thousands of indicators to give us insight into a particular aspect of the economy: inflation rates, consumer price indices, unemployment numbers, gross domestic product, economic activity, etc.</p>
<div class="assignment">

<p>What are the indicators used for–that is, what do they indicate?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An indicator is called <strong>leading</strong> if it is predictive, informing us about what might happen in the future. The job satisfaction in an employee survey is a leading indicator of employee attrition in the future. Unhappy employees are more likely to quit and to move on to other jobs. A <strong>lagging</strong> indicator is descriptive, it looks at what has happened in the past. Last month’s resignation rate is a lagging indicator for the human resources department.</p>
</section>
<section id="types-of-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-data">Types of Data</h3>
<p>Data, the result of quantification, can be classified in a number of ways. The first distinction of quantified variables is by <strong>data type</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Continuous</strong>: the number of possible values of the variable is not countable. Examples are physical measurements such as weight, height, length, pressure, temperature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discrete</strong>: the number of possible values is countable. Even if the number of possible values is infinite, the variable is still discrete. The number of fish caught per day does not have a theoretical upper limit, although it is highly unlikely that a weekend warrior will catch 1,000 fish. A commercial fishing vessel might.<br>
<br>
Discrete variables are further divided into the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Count Variables</strong>: the values are true counts, obtained by enumeration. There are two types of counts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Counts per unit</strong>: the count relates to a unit of measurement, e.g., the number of fish caught per day, the number of customer complaints per quarter, the number of chocolate chips per cookie, the number of cancer incidences per 100,000.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proportions (Counts out of a total)</strong>: the count can be converted to a proportion by dividing it with a maximum value. Examples are the number of heads out of 10 coin tosses, the number of larvae out of 20 succumbing to an insecticide,</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Categorical Variables</strong>: the values consist of labels, even if numbers are used for labeling.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Nominal variables</strong>: The labels are unordered, for example the variable “fruit” takes on the values “apple”, “peach”, “tomato” (yes, tomatoes are fruit but do not belong in fruit salad).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ordinal variables</strong>: the category labels can be arranged in a natural order in a lesser-greater sense. Examples are 1—5 star reviews or ratings of severity (“mild”, “modest”, “severe”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Binary variables</strong>: take on exactly two values (dead/alive, Yes/No, 1/0, fraud/not fraud, diseased/not diseased)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Categorical variables are also called <strong>qualitative</strong> variables. They encode a quality, namely to belong to one of the categories. All other variables are also called <strong>quantitative</strong> variables. Note that quantifying something through numbers does not imply it is a quantitative variable. Highway exits might have numbers that are simple identifiers not related to distances. The number of stars on a 5-star rating scale indicates the category, not a quantified amount. The numeric values of quantitative variables, on the other hand, can be used to calculate meaningful differences and ratios. 40 kg is twice as much as 20 kg, but a 4-star review is not twice as much as a 2-star review—it is simply higher than a 2-star review.</p>
</section>
<section id="uncertainty" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="uncertainty">Uncertainty</h3>
<p>When I hop on the scales in the bathroom in the morning, I usually take two or three measurements in quick succession. They rarely are identical, differing by a fraction of a pound. Day-to-day variation could be understandable, our weight does change over time. But second-to-second variation, that seems odd. It seems unlikely that I gained or lost a quarter pound over the last 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Quantifying things is associated with <strong>uncertainty</strong> that is introduced through various forms of <strong>variability</strong>. My weight measurement varies from one measurement to the next because of my posture, movement on the scales, and the performance of the scales mechanism itself. Not because my actual weight differs. This type of variability is called <strong>measurement error</strong>. If we measure the weights of students in a classroom another source of variability is introduced, subject-to-subject variability. If we randomly choose a classroom from the school, the measurements also represent classroom-to-classroom variability, since repeating the process and selecting a different classroom will yield a different number.</p>
<p>In the presence of uncertainty, quantities are not knowable a priori. But if the uncertainty itself can be quantified, then the quantity of interest is predictable. I am unable to say what the average weight is of a student in a freshman class. But by measuring weights and quantifying uncertainty in the observations I can <strong>predict</strong> with a high level of confidence that the average freshmen students’ weight is between this much and that much (now attach your favorite weight units).</p>
<p>It is one of humanities’ great advances that we are not only able to represent concepts in numbers, but that we can quantify uncertainty itself. Probability and statistics enable us to learn from uncertain events and measurements. This adds to our vocabulary of lengths, weights, volumes, five-star ratings, and so on, the terms prediction, forecast, likelihood, odds, chance, and probability.</p>
<p>A meteorologist forecasting a 30% chance of rain tomorrow is quantifying the likelihood of an event. We all know how to operationalize this forecast. The higher the number, the more likely we will need an umbrella the next day. Interestingly, while we have developed intuition about “the chance of rain”, many do not know how to correctly interpret a statement such as “30% chance of rain”. It does not mean that 30% of the area covered by the forecast will see rain. It does not mean that on days like today, 30% of them will have a rain event. Rather, it means that there is a 0.3 probability that <strong>any</strong> point in the forecast area will see a measurable amount of rain (usually 0.01 inches or more).</p>
<p>Another interpretation flows from the fact that weather forecasts are based on models that simulate weather conditions based on inputs. To account for the inherent uncertainty in measuring the inputs, multiple scenarios (simulations) are run. a 30% chance of rain means that 30% of the simulations predicted rain for the forecast area.</p>
<hr>
<p>By applying statistical principles in the analysis of data uncertainty can be reduced. More informed insights about the data are then possible. Suppose we want to measure the average amount of an attribute in a population—say, the average years of postgraduate education. The population is too large to visit with every member so we instead quiz only a smaller number about their education. If we randomly sample one person from the population, we get a statistically valid estimate for the entire population. If they have 2 years of postgraduate education, our best guess for the average amount of post-graduate education in the entire population is 2 years. However, we have not reduced the uncertainty at all, the single measurement is as uncertain as the variability of postgraduate education years in the population. Suppose this variability can be quantified with the amount <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. If we repeat the process of randomly sampling persons <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> more times and computing the average across the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> measurements—this is called the <strong>sample average</strong>—we get a much better estimate of the average number of years of postgraduate education in the population. It turns out that the sample average so obtained has uncertainty <span class="math inline">\(X/n\)</span>. In other words, we can make our statement about the population quantity of interest arbitrarily precise by sampling a large number of people from the population.</p>
<p>For attributes with large variability <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> it will take a larger sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to achieve the same level of precision compared to attributes with less variability. If the attribute does not vary at all in the population (<span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span>), then a single sample is sufficient.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="benefits-of-quantification">Benefits of Quantification</h3>
<p>The first obvious benefit of quantification is to make information amenable to mathematical and statistical operations. When mathematical or statistical calculations are concerned, any type of data will eventually be represented as numbers. A photograph turns into row and column indices of pixels and three-number triplets of red, green, and blue intensities. A sophisticated large language model that processes textual information converts the text into numeric representations, a process called <strong>encoding</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Huff_1954">Huff (<a href="references.html#ref-Huff_1954" role="doc-biblioref">1954</a>)</span>, in one of the most widely published statistics texts, <em>How to Lie with Statistics</em> states</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Many a statistic is false on its face. It gets by only because the magic of numbers brings about a suspension of common sense.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to one view, the de-contextualized and value-free mathematical symbols used in statistical analyses assist in achieving objectivity, stability, and fairness in decisions. Quantification is a method of standardization that summarizes and reduces concepts to their essence and allows us to make better decisions.</p>
<p>Objective metrics by which to measure allows us to establish rank and status. Status of nations can be measured by GDP (Gross Domestic Product). A countries’ portion of global GPD is one of the criteria for G20 membership. Quantified status is a much better solution than determining status by sending soldiers across borders.</p>
<p>Quantification allows us to express relationships: ranking, ordering, and measuring proximity. As we will see in a later chapter, sorting and searching are fundamental. As an exercise observe how many times a day you encounter sorted lists, rankings, top-ten results, best-of lists, most-preferred lists and other forms of arranging information by a relevance metric. Google search would not be so successful if searching would not be combined with ranking results by relevance.</p>

<section id="surrogacy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="surrogacy">Surrogacy</h3>
<p>A <strong>surrogate</strong> metric is one that is used in the place of another. We have seen earlier how economic indicators are used to describe aspects of the economy:</p>
<ul>
<li>The consumer price index is a surrogate metric for consumer behavior, for example.</li>
<li>The net promoter score is a surrogate metric for customer loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>When quantifying a variable of interest is difficult, time consuming, expensive, or destructive, and a surrogate variable is easy to quantify, the surrogate can take the place of the variable of interest.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of surrogacy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cardiovascular health: directly measuring cardiovascular health is difficult. Cholesterol levels are used as a proxy for heart health.</p></li>
<li><p>Education:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardized test scores as surrogates for student achievement.</li>
<li>Graduation rates as a proxy for work force preparation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Economy: Gross domestic product as a surrogate for societal well-being.</p></li>
<li><p>Environmental science:</p>
<ul>
<li>CO2 levels as proxy for climate change.</li>
<li>Tree canopy cover as a proxy for biodiversity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Employment: Measuring employee productivity by number of hours worked or by number of days in the office (vs.&nbsp;WFH).</p></li>
<li><p>Technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of downloads of an app as a measure of market share.</li>
<li>Likes and shares as a measure of social media engagement</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Academia: Citation count as a surrogate for research impact.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Surrogate measurements are very often necessary, but they are not without issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>They might not capture all factors influencing the attribute of interest.</li>
<li>They can lead to oversimplification and misinterpretation.</li>
<li>The surrogate might not measure what is most relevant. For example, standardized test scores do not measure critical thinking.</li>
<li>They can lead to <strong>surrogation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<section id="surrogation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="surrogation">Surrogation</h4>
<p><strong>Surrogation</strong> occurs when people or organizations substitute a metric for the underlying concept or goal that the metric is intended to represent. Instead of treating the metric as a proxy or tool to measure progress, they treat it as the ultimate goal itself. The metric has become the goal.</p>
<p>When standardized test scores are a surrogate for student achievement, surrogation means to focus on driving up the test scores rather than focusing on driving actual student achievement.</p>
<p>Surrogation of net promoter scores occurs when companies focus on driving up NPS by only asking customers that repeatedly buy their product. The goal is to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, the NPS should increase as a result. Surrogation focuses on the NPS, not the actual customer satisfaction. The first mistake in surrogation is to assume that the surrogate is exactly what it is a proxy for. To assume that the net promoter score is a proxy for customer satisfaction it is not customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Sales people are often incentivized on number of deals or deal volume (revenue). The underlying goal is to drive success for the company. Surrogation can lead to closing of deals that are bad for the company (losing money on the deal) but work in favor of the sales person’s metric to hit a revenue target.</p>
<hr>
<p>When metrics are tied to performance evaluation, resource assignment, advancement, surrogation is common. It leads to distorted priorities and bad behavior (gaming the system): people try to meet the metric without achieving the underlying goal.</p>
<p>Another aspect of surrogation is to prioritize the simple fixes and quick wins instead of the deeper but more expensive and difficult corrections. A hospital might focus on amenities or quick ER service rather than improving health outcomes for its patients. A social media content creator generates click bait in order to increase clicks rather than focusing on meaningful engagement.</p>

<p>One method for quantifying the aerobic fitness of athletes is through testing their aerobic capacity under stress (<a href="#fig-aerobic-fit" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.7</span></a>). These measurements are time consuming and expensive.</p>

Figure&nbsp;1.7: Measuring aerobic capacity.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Imagine that you conduct a study in which a number of athletes are subjected to aerobic capacity tests on a machine similar to that shown in <a href="#fig-aerobic-fit" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.7</span></a>. In addition to measuring their aerobic capacity, you also measure simple-to-obtain attributes such as heart rate, rest pulse, run pulse, distance run, etc.</p>
<p>Then, you develop a model that can predict aerobic capacity from the easy-to-measure attributes. If that model works well, you can predict the aerobic capacity of an athlete by obtaining their heart rate, pulse, rest pulse, etc. The prediction from that model is a surrogate for the unobserved aerobic fitness measurement.</p>
<p>This is an example of a <strong>regression model</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="example">
<div class="example-header">
<p>Example: Nail Pull Test</p>
</div>
<div class="example-container">
<p>The force required to pull a nail out of a gypsum board (dry wall) is a measure of the board quality. Unfortunately, the test is destructive and the tested board cannot be used. To circumvent the problem and have more boards to sell, a regression model can be built to predict the nail pull strength from other attributes such as the dry wall material, the thickness of the wall, the method of construction, humidity, temperature, etc.</p>
<p>These attributes are easy to measure and non-destructive. When the regression model works well—that is, it explains a sufficient degree of variation in nail pull strengths across gypsum boards—the prediction from the model can be used as surrogate for the actual board nail pull strength.</p>
