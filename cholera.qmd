# Case Study: 1854 Cholera Outbreak in Soho, London {#sec-cholera}

## Two Snows

In 1854, a severe outbreak of cholera occurred near Broad Street in Soho, London,
killing over 600 people. The outbreak was studied by John Snow, considered one 
of the founders of modern epidemiology. No, not the Jon Snow you might be thinking 
of, Lord Commander of the Night Watch (@fig-jon-snow), but the John Snow in
@fig-john-snow.

## Visualization {#sec-cholera-viz}

@fig-cholera-map shows the map drawn by John Snow, recording the number of
cholera cases with stacked bars at the location where cholera cases occurred (click on the 
map to zoom in). Also shown on the map as black circles and annotated as "PUMP" 
are the public water pumps throughout the city. The high number of cholera cases 
on Broad Street stands out, and they seem to be clustered near the location of 
the Broad Street Pump [@Snow1855, p.46].

Cholera had been a major problem in the city, thousands had died during previous 
outbreaks. The prevailing theories of the cause of cholera were (i), airborne particles,
called *miasma* that rose from decomposing organic material and (ii), an as of
yet unidentified germ. According to the miasma theory, cholera is contracted by
breathing bad air. John Snow adhered to the germ theory and believed that it
was transmitted through contaminated water.

## Data Validation {#sec-cholera-data}

Talking to residents, Snow identified the public water pump on Broad Street to 
be the source of the outbreak. He failed to identify *the germ* under the microscope
but came to the conclusion based on the pattern in the data and conversations
with residents. Investigating on the ground, he found that nearly all deaths 
were in the vicinity of the Broad Street Pump or by people who had consumed water 
from the pump [@Snow1855, p.47]:

>*It will be observed that the deaths either very much diminished, or ceased altogether, at every point where it becomes decidedly nearer to send to another pump than to the one in Broad street. It may also be noticed that the deaths are most numerous near to the pump where the water could be more readily obtained.*

He persuaded local authorities to remove the handle from the pump to prevent access
to the water. The mortality rate declined after that, but it is believed that the
outbreak was already in decline as people had fled the area. 

:::{.callout-note title="Removing the handle"}
"Removing the handle" is now a term in epidemiology for the removal of a harmful 
agent from the environment. When epidemiologists look for simple answers to
questions about epidemics, they ask "Where is the handle to this pump?" [@CompThinking].

There were some data points (outliers?) that did not agree with the hypothesis that
proximity to the Broad Street pump resulted in more cholera incidences. At the
intersection of Broad Street and New Street was the Lion Brewery; there were no
cholera cases at the brewery although it used water from the Broad Street pump. It turns
out that the workers there were protected from cholera by virtue of a daily
beer allowance. The cholera bacteria is killed in the brewing process making the
beer safe to drink. Drinking beer instead of the contaminated water saved the 
workers from cholera. What appears as an outlier to the model actually reinforces
it.

@CompThinking discuss other data points that appeared initially as anomalies and
ended up implicating the public pump on Broad Street:

- There were deaths in houses closer to the Rupert Street pump than the Broad Street pump. 
It was more convenient for those residents to use the Broad Street pump due to 
the street layout.

- Deaths in houses several blocks away from the Broad Street pump were linked to
children who drank from the Broad Street pump on their way to school.

- John Snow was initially puzzled by two isolated deaths in the Hampstead area, 
far from Soho. He learned that the deceased had once lived in Broad Street. 
Because they liked the taste, they had water from the Broad Street pump delivered
to Hampstead every day. 

The well accessed by the Broad Street pump was contaminated with fecal bacteria
that leaked into the well from a nearby cesspit. Sewage from the house of a cholera
victim had contaminated the well.

## Toward Causality {#sec-cholera-deeper}

The evidence that the contaminated well water at the Broad Street pump caused
the high rate of cholera in that neighborhood and among those who consumed the
water is strong. Is it conclusive, however? Have we ruled out any other explanation
*beyond a reasonable doubt*? 

There could be other explanations for the higher cholera incidence rate in the
Broad Street neighborhood compared to other areas of London. Maybe the diet is
different among the residents of that poorer area. Maybe their occupations expose
them to harmful agents at work. Maybe there is something different in the way
their houses were constructed. 

While we know today that the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae* causes cholera, that 
discovery was not made until 1883 and John Snow had failed to identify a "germ"
when he studied the Broad Street pump water. The prevailing miasma theory of
infection from airborne particles also did not support Snow's findings. While
his data, visualization, and analysis showed a strong association between 
cholera and proximity to the Broad Street pump, a deeper analysis was necessary
to convince his contemporaries.

To establish cause and effect and prove that a variable causes an outcome, 
modern science would design and run an experiment, provided it is ethically 
and technically possible. In such an experiment one would control for all other
factors except the one hypothesized to cause the outcome. One method of controlling
these **confounding** factors is by randomly assigning the conditions of interest
to people and to observe what happens. Exposing folks deliberately to contaminated 
water that could harm or even kill them is not justified. Fortunately, John Snow
found a real-life experiment with perfect conditions to establish cause and 
effect between cholera and water contamination.

He studied the cholera incidences among recipients of water from two water supply
companies. The Lambeth company used water from the River Thames drawn upriver from 
sewage discharge and the Southwark \& Vauxhall company drew water below the 
discharge. Snow also established that for all intents and purposes the households
receiving water from either company were indistinguishable; in statistical terms
they were comparable. The only thing that differentiated the two groups was the
water supplier. @Snow1855 [p. 75] wrote 

>*In many cases a single house has a supply different from that on either side. Each company supplies both rich and poor, both large houses and small; there is no difference in the condition or occupation of the persons receiving the water of the different companies...As there is no difference whatever either in the houses or the people receiving the supply of the two Water Companies, or in any of the physical conditions with which they are surrounded, it is obvious that no experiment could have been devised which would more thoroughly test the effect of water supply on the progress of Cholera than this, which circumstances placed ready made before the observer.*

@tbl-chol-rate is based on @Snow1855 [p. 80] and covers the period from 
January 1 to December 12, 1853. The cholera death rate on a 
per 10,000 house basis is almost 14 times higher in households supplied by 
Southwark \& Vauxhall compared to those who received their water from Lambeth.

| Water Supplier | No. of Houses | Cholera Deaths | Deaths per 10,000 Houses |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Southwark \& Vauxhall1 | 40,046 | 286 | 71 |
| Lambeth | 26,107 | 14 | 5 |

: Cholera incidences and rates for two water supply companies leading up to the 1854 outbreak. {#tbl-chol-rate .striped}

In all of London there were 563 deaths from cholera in the same period. In other
words, 50\% of the deaths took place among customers of the Southwark \& Vauxhall
company. Ouch.

For the first seven week period of the 1854 outbreak, @Snow1855 [p. 86] recorded
the death rates in @tbl-chol-rate2

| Water Supplier | No. of Houses | Cholera Deaths | Deaths per 10,000 Houses |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Southwark \& Vauxhall1 | 40,046 | 1,263 | 315 |
| Lambeth | 26,107 | 98 | 37 |
| Rest of London | 256,423 | 1,422 | $55^*$ |

: Cholera incidences and rates during the first seven weeks of the outbreak. The death rate in the rest of London was reported as 59 in Table IX of @Snow1855, but calculates to 55 deaths per 10,000. {#tbl-chol-rate2 .striped}

In statistical terms, such a difference in the death rates is **highly significant**,
meaning that if there is no difference in the water quality between the suppliers,
such a discrepancy would virtually never happen. The only reasonable explanation
for the higher death rate, since differences between the groups receiving the 
water have been ruled out, is the quality (contamination) of the Southwark \&
Vauxhall water.
