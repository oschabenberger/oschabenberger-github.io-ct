<p>In the introduction we defined an algorithm as a set of repeatable step-by-step instructions to solve a particular problem. Algorithms are not necessarily the machinations of computer scientists and mathematicians—recall making pumpkin soup. We design and apply algorithms in every day life. You probably have a personal algorithm or two for brushing teeth or making the bed.</p>

<p>My dog has developed an elaborate algorithm for nights when he wants to sleep in the bed. He starts out sleeping in his dog bed on the floor and the algorithm goes something like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Get up and pretend there is something outside that needs his attention: a squirrel in a tree, a raccoon on the porch, a deer in the yard, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that I understand the severity of the threat and follow him to the living room. This can involve growling at the door to the deck, running back and forth between living room and bed room.</p></li>
<li><p>I finally get up, follow him into the living room and open the door to the deck.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point he pretends to realize that there is no threat after all and we can go back to bed.</p></li>
<li><p>He follows me into the bedroom, positioning himself next to the bed in the unmistakable posture that says “lift me up on the bed please.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To his credit, he could jump on the bed by himself and is going through this routine as a means to get permission. The algorithm is complicated, but it is a repeatable step-by-step recipe, and it works every time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Algorithms are designed to perform a task in some optimal way. My dog applies the above algorithm to achieve the optimal sleeping arrangement—by his standard. Mathematicians and computer scientists have developed many algorithms to solve certain problems optimally. If you have to put five books on a shelf in order, you might not worry much about the sorting algorithm. When you have to sort 100,000 items choosing between a bubble, quick, or merge sort matters much more.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: Can we apply what mathematicians and computer scientists know about optimal algorithms to solve problems in everyday life? If you were searching for an apartment in San Francisco and finally sign a lease you might not be happy with the outcome; maybe there were better apartments and better deals out there. If you went about the search in an optimal way, then you can live with the outcome knowing that the process maximized your probability of finding the best apartment. The algorithm defines the best process although it does not guarantee the best outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: What can we learn from how computer scientists think about algorithms about how to design systems and make decisions in every day life? Computer scientists study the complexity of algorithms, trying to reduce the computational burden of a solution. Can that inform how we interact with each other? Are you more likely to land a successful meeting invite on the calendar if you ask the meeting participants which time works best for them or if you tell them “next Wednesday at 11:00 am”? It turns out it is the latter, because it presents a constrained solution which has a lower cognitive burden than “which time is most convenient for you?”.</p>
<p>The discussion that follows draws on the book <em>Algorithms to Live By</em> by <span class="citation" data-cites="ChristianGriffiths">Christian and Griffiths (<a href="references.html#ref-ChristianGriffiths" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>.</p>

<section id="optimal-stoppingthe-37-rule" class="level2" data-number="8.2">
<h2 data-number="8.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimal-stoppingthe-37-rule"><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Optimal Stopping–The 37% Rule</h2>
<p>Suppose you just landed a job at a Silicon-Valley startup company and are locating to San Francisco. Finding an apartment in San Francisco can be a rough experience: there is a lot of demand for a short supply. As a newcomer to town you do not have a good feeling for the market. What do typical apartments in your price range look like? What is available on the market?</p>
<p>Here is the dilemma: you cannot procrastinate much when you see an available apartment; they go very fast. But if you choose the first available apartment you will miss out on better ones that you have not seen yet. If you pass on the first available apartment there is no guarantee that the next ones will be any better. But you need to look at least at a few of them to get a feeling for what is on the market. How else could you make an informed decision? But if you keep looking at apartments and pass on them you might end up with no apartment at all or you have to choose from what is left on the market. Is looking at 2 apartments enough? 20?</p>
<p>There are two ways in which you can fail: stop looking at apartments too early and stop looking too late. When you stop too early a better apartment goes undiscovered. If you stop too late you hold out for a better apartment that does not exist, you have passed on the best possible apartment already.</p>
<p>This is known as an <strong>optimal stopping</strong> problem. How much effort should you spend on <em>looking</em> at choices and when should you <em>leap</em> and make a decision?</p>
<p>It turns out that there is an answer. The optimal decision rule is to spend 37% of your budget on calibrating and looking at apartments to establish a standard. Then pick the next apartment that beats the standard. If your budget is one month to find an apartment, then you should look and calibrate for 11 days.</p>
<p>We can thank computer science for having an optimal solution to balance overthinking and impulse decision. No more analysis paralysis if you apply the 37% rule. You can see how the algorithm could be applied to other situations in real life:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much time should you spend circling a parking lot before committing to a spot in the hope that a better spot opens up?</li>
<li>How many offers should you reject before selling the car or house in the hope to get a better offer?</li>
<li>How long should you be dating before finding the “optimal” partner?</li>
</ul>
<p>The 37% rule is not optimal in all decision problems. Situations where the rule applies are characterized by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to choose a singleton (one apartment, one parking spot, one partner).</li>
<li>There are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> possible choices and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is known.</li>
<li>It is possible to rank all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> choices from best to worst.</li>
<li>The choices appear sequentially in a random order.</li>
<li>After meeting a choice, a decision is made immediately to reject or accept it.</li>
<li>A choice cannot be revisited after rejection or acceptance.</li>
<li>If you come to the final (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span><sup>th</sup>) choice you have to take it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The optimum achieved by the 37% rule is to maximize <strong>the probability</strong> to select the best choice among the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> possibilities. The rule does not guarantee that <em>the</em> best choice is made. But no other rule has a higher probability of finding the best choice under the circumstances.</p>
<section id="the-secretary-problem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-secretary-problem">The Secretary Problem</h3>
<p>The optimal stopping problem is also known as the <em>secretary</em> problem, the <em>sultan’s dowry</em> problem, the <em>fussy suitor</em> problem or the <em>marriage</em> problem. In terms of hiring a secretary, it goes as follows.</p>
<p>You want to hire the best secretary out of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> applicants for a position. Applicants are interviewed in a random order one by one. After the interview you decide whether to accept or reject the candidate. If you reject an applicant they take another job and cannot be reconsidered. While interviewing the applicant you gather information that allows you to rank the candidate against those interviewed so far but you do not know the quality of the yet to-be-interviewed candidates.</p>
<p>The 37% rule states that you should be evaluating the first 37% applicants to create a ranking. That completes the <em>looking</em> phase. Then <em>leap</em> and make an offer to the next applicant that ranks higher than the best applicant interviewed during the looking phase.</p>
<p>But wait, what if there is only one applicant? Or two?</p>
<p>With a single applicant you need to hire them, and you are guaranteed to have hired the best of the (single) bunch. With two applicants, if you pass on the first, you have to hire the second. In this case you can flip a coin, either hire the first or pass and be forced to hire the second—you cannot do better than chance. With <span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span> candidates the optimal rule is to look at the first candidate, then choose the second candidate if they beat the first. This is a 1/3 x 100% = 33.3% rule and has a 50% probability of finding the best candidate.</p>
<p>As <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases, the optimal rule approaches <span class="math inline">\(1/e \times 100\% = 36.8\%\)</span> and that is also the probability of finding the best candidate. Round that percentage up and you see why it is called the 37% rule.</p>
<p>You might say that a 37% chance of making the best choice is not very good. In 63% of all cases we are not finding the best candidate. The result is not that bad if you compare it against a pure random chance. If there are 100 candidates for the position, then a random choice has a 1% chance of getting the best candidate. In a pool of 1,000 candidates, random selection has a 0.1% chance of locating the best. However, the odds of finding the best candidate under the optimal stopping rule does not change. The more choices you have, the better optimal stopping performs relative to random selection. But even with only three candidates the likelihood of finding the best candidate has improved from 1 out of 3 to 1 out of 2.</p>

<section id="issues-with-the-optimal-stopping-rule" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="issues-with-the-optimal-stopping-rule">Issues with the Optimal Stopping Rule</h3>
<p>But wait, you say. Pure random selection is not the appropriate benchmark against which to compare the optimal stopping rule. This is not how we hire people in the real world. In other words, the situation where the 37% rule applies does not describe how we do things.</p>
<p>What are some of the ways in which the optimal stopping setup is unrealistic:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We often do not know <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the number of choices. For example, we might not know how many apartments in San Francisco are on the market. There is a workaround: if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is unknown, we can base the 37% rule on a time interval: we give ourselves one month to find an apartment and enter the leap phase after 10 or 11 days.</p></li>
<li><p>The choices do not come to us in a random order. In an interview process there are short lists and candidates are screened and filtered. The order in which candidates come to the interview is not completely at random.</p></li>
<li><p>After rejecting a candidate, we do have the option to go back. If it turns out that none of the other candidates was better than a candidate rejected earlier, then we can go back and reconsider the choice. After rejecting a date, we can ask them on another date—theoretically.</p></li>
<li><p>In real life, we are not making decisions after seeing a candidate. Instead, applicants are grouped (pre-screening, initial phone interview, on-site interview, …) and choices are made after each batch of candidates.</p></li>
<li><p>The optimal stopping problem assumes that we do not have a ranking of the candidates. It only assumes that there is an objective method of ranking them and that we rank as we go. Obviously, candidates are evaluated based on many criteria and these are known ahead of time. The look phase of the optimal stopping exists because it is needed to calibrate what good candidates look like. We know this a priori of time, and we can evaluate candidates (somewhat) based on their resumes.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not only have a sense of which candidate ranks higher or lower, but also by how much. Meeting a candidate that really stands out changes the likelihood of making a decision. If you know that a candidate is in the top 10% of SAT or GRE scores, there is only a 1 in 10 chance that others will be better.</p></li>
<li><p>The job will be offered to a candidate in the <em>leap</em> phase, not the <em>looking</em> phase. The Human Resources and the Legal departments are probably going to have a conniption if the first 37% of candidates being interviewed have no chance of getting the job. Queue the lawsuits. Your dates might not respond kindly when they find out that you are “just looking”.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The optimal stopping scenario and the 37% rule are useful to construct a mental model of how to go about a decision that involves sequentially evaluating choices and deciding on a particular choice. As with any model, we have to examine the assumptions and conditions under which the model applies. We quickly see that the assumptions do not map cleanly to real-life situations such as hiring, finding a partner, or even circling a parking lot for the best empty space.</p>
<p>Recall from <a href="datascience.html#sec-data-science-models-wrong" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 4.2.5</span></a> the famous G.E.P. Box quote</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>All models are wrong. Some are useful.</p>
</div>
<p>The utility of casting real-life decision situations in terms of an optimal stopping problem lies in understanding that under special circumstances there is an optimal way to balance impulse and procrastination and to realize in what ways our decision situation deviates from that scenario. Are we in a <strong>no-information</strong> scenario as in the classical secretary problem where we have no a-priori data about the quality of the applicants or are we in a <strong>full-information</strong> scenario where the quality of all applicants can be quantified a priori? If it is the latter we should come to a decision more quickly than going through at least 37% of the stack.</p>
<p>A situation where the algorithm applies cleanly to a real-life situation is when we are placing things in order—the task of sorting. The question then is what is the most efficient way to go about it?</p>

<p><strong>Searching</strong> means finding things in a collection. <strong>Sorting</strong> means arranging a collection in order. Both are fundamental tasks in data processing. Sorting was one of the first applications for computers, making sense of the 1890 census. The census takes place every ten years and with increasing population and more questions asked on each census the burden of counting up the answers was growing. Doing this by hand was getting tricky. Tallying the previous census by hand took 8 years, just enough to finish the task before the 1890 census <span class="citation" data-cites="ChristianGriffiths">(<a href="references.html#ref-ChristianGriffiths" role="doc-biblioref">Christian and Griffiths 2017</a>)</span>. Something needed to be done, the 1890 census could not be tallied by hand in time for the 1900 census. Enter the Tabulator, a punch card-based machine invented by Herman Hollerith and adapted for the 1890 census (<a href="#fig-hollerith" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>8.2</span></a>).</p>

<ul>
<li>Sports teams are ranked by criteria such as number of wins and losses, and displayed from highest to lowest.</li>
<li>Music is ranked by popularity, measured as number of downloads, sales, etc.</li>
<li>Music is grouped (sorted) by genre.</li>
<li>Streaming services recommend things to watch according to an algorithm that ranks shows based on your watch history.</li>
<li>Displays of countries are sorted by all kinds of attributes. The medal count in the Olympic Games, gross domestic product (GDP), annual oil production, emissions, etc.</li>
<li>A Google search returns the search results sorted according to relevance. The relevance is determined through a number of factors such as Google’s famed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> algorithm, which sites are sponsored, and so forth. Without sorting the search results you would have to sift through millions of links to determine which ones are most relevant to your search. The ranking is very effective, less than 1% of Google searches scroll to the second page.</li>
</ul>

- The email Inbox is sorted by some criteria, read/unread, message thread, time 
of arrival, etc.

- On computers, files and folders can be arranged by attributes such as size,
time of creation, time of modification, name, etc.

- The U.S. Postal Service sorts mail by zip code.

- Social media sites create personalized feeds based on sorting contributions
according to their algorithms.

- Searching for items in an online store you can arrange the results by

<section id="the-searchsort-tradeoff" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-searchsort-tradeoff">The Search–Sort Tradeoff</h3>
<p>In business, economy of scales is the achievement of cost advantages through increase of production (increase of scale). By producing more items the fixed cost of production such as building a factory are spread across a larger number of items, reducing the fixed cost per item. Striving for greater scale and scalability is an important business and technology driver. With searching and sorting, however, size is kryptonite. From <span class="citation" data-cites="ChristianGriffiths">Christian and Griffiths (<a href="references.html#ref-ChristianGriffiths" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>Sorting involves steep <em>dis</em>economies of scale, violating our normal intuitions about the virtues of doing things in bulk. Cooking for two is typically no harder than cooking for one, and it’s certainly easier than cooking for one person twice. But sorting, say, a shelf of a hundred books will take you longer than sorting two bookshelves of fifty apiece: you have twice as many things to organize, and there are twice as many places each of them could go. The more you take on, the worse it gets.</p>
</div>
<p>That begs the question: should we even sort at all? One reason for sorting is to facilitate searching. Since the books of the library are sorted on shelves, knowing that you are in the QA section makes it easy to search for a book with a QB call number. Could we find the QB book if the library arranges books in a random order? It depends on how fast we can search the library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorting something that you will never look at and you will never search is a complete waste of time and resources.</li>
<li>If searching is fast then you should reduce the amount of effort spent on sorting. Maybe partially sorted lists (a bucket for all names starting with letters A-D, a bucket for all names starting with E–H, …) are sufficient.</li>
<li>If searching is really fast, we might not benefit from sorting first at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the public library or the university library, the tradeoff between sorting and searching is resolved by sorting the entire catalog. For the books in your home sorting as a preemptive strike for fast searching is probably not necessary. The time it takes you to scan a familiar bookshelf or two does not justify the time spent arranging the books alphabetically.</p>
<p>A classic example of the tradeoff is how we organize our email. There are basically two extreme approaches with many nuances in between. The first approach is to leave everything in your Inbox, your email is completely unorganized. The other extreme is to create a meticulous system of folder and sub folders (or labels) to classify email messages you keep. Which system is better in terms of finding an email message you received previously?</p>
<p>Searching electronic items is many times faster than searching through physical books in the library. The cost of searching even through a massive Inbox is tiny these days. When it comes to locating an email, sorting the messages first and arranging them in folders is a waste of time. Clicking through the folders to locate an email takes more time than locating it with a search. There are other benefits of grouping and arranging messages, such as archiving or not being overwhelmed by the look of an Inbox out of control. Interestingly, all mail clients cite organizing email in folders or labels as a way to make it easier to find the information you need.</p>

<p>Sorting suffers from <em>dis</em>economies of scale. Sorting larger lists is much harder than sorting shorter lists. The development of sorting algorithms that can handle large lists efficiently has a long history in computer science. Let’s look at a few common sorting algorithms.</p>
<section id="bubble-sort" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bubble-sort">Bubble sort</h4>
<p>The bubble sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. It is also very inefficient compared to other algorithms. In computer science, the bubble sort is a punching bag of sorts. Don’t get caught bubble sorting data unless you are told to do so.</p>
<p>Suppose you scan the list of items you wish to sort. If you find two items that are in the wrong order you change their positions. When you come to the end of the list, start over at the beginning of the list. Once you reach the end of the list and there were no pairs of items out of order the sort is complete.</p>

<section id="insertion-sort" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="insertion-sort">Insertion sort</h4>
<p>Instead of arranging all items in a list and making individual swaps, we can start with an empty list and add items to it one by one. Suppose you want to arrange the items in ascending order. Pick the first item and consider it the middle of the list. If the next item is smaller, put it before the first item, otherwise place it after the first item. Starting with the third item you run through the existing list (which now has two items in it) from top to bottom and place the new item between the two items that bracket its value. You continue this process until all items have been placed on the list.</p>
<p>This procedure is called the <strong>insertion sort</strong>. It is also very intuitive and more efficient than the bubble sort but not nearly as efficient as more advanced (and less intuitive) sorting algorithms.</p>
<p>Suppose you with to sort the list {3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 2, 6, 1} in ascending order by insertion sort.</p>
<p>Step 1. You start with the first element, 3. It is now the only element of the sorted list: {3}</p>
<p>Step 2. The next element under consideration is 7. Since it is larger than 3 the sorted list is now {3, 7}</p>
<p>Step 3. The next element under consideration is 4. Starting from the top of the list, the value slots in between 3 and 4: {3, 4, 7}</p>
<p>Step 4. The next element under consideration is 9. Starting from the top of the list you make it all the way to the end before it slots into place: {3, 4, 7, 9}.</p>

<section id="mergesort" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mergesort">Mergesort</h4>
<p>Bubble and insertion sorts work, they produce ordered lists. Unfortunately, these algorithms are not time efficient, meaning that they require many more operations (comparisons) than is necessary to sort a list. As the size of the list grows, these algorithms become untenable. A different approach is needed.</p>
<p>Mergesort (or Merge sort) is an example of a <strong>divide-and-conquer</strong> algorithm. Such an algorithm breaks a larger problem down into smaller sub-problems, solves each sub-problem by itself and combines the results into the solution for the overall problem. <em>Divide</em> the problem into smaller parts, <em>conquer</em> each part and combine the partial solutions into the solution to the original problem.</p>
<p>We divide-and-conquer in real life as well. To cut up a pie into 8 slices a good approach is to cut it in half, then cut the halves in half, then cut those pieces in half. The problem of getting to eight equally-sized slices is solved by dividing it into parts with simple solutions: <em>cut something in half</em>. The divide-and-conquer solution to this problem works well because we are much better at dividing something in two equal parts than into eight equal parts.</p>
<p>When you approach a jigsaw puzzle by grouping the pieces into border and non-border pieces, then organize them by color, pattern, or shape within the group, you are applying the divide-and-conquer principle.</p>
<p>How does this relate to sorting? We know how to sort short lists. And we know how to combine two sorted lists. Suppose you have a list of two elements and a list of two other elements. You can quickly arrange them into a single list of four elements, this is called <strong>collation</strong>.</p>
<p>The Mergesort algorithm works as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Divide the unsorted list of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> sub-lists, each containing a single element.</p></li>
<li><p>Take two neighboring sub-lists and merge them. Now you have <span class="math inline">\(n/2\)</span> sub-lists of size 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the step of merging two adjacent sub-lists until there are only two sub-lists remaining. When you merge those the original list is sorted.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The divide-and-conquer idea can also be applied to the division of the original list in step 1. <a href="#fig-merge-sort" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>8.4</span></a> is an example of the entire procedure. The set {7, 3, 2, 16, 24, 4, 11, 9} is to be sorted. The first four rows of the figure show divide-and-conquer applied to the original list to create the individual elements of the merge sort operation.</p>

<h2 data-number="8.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computational-kindness"><span class="header-section-number">8.4</span> Computational Kindness</h2>
<p>In designing functions and algorithms, computer scientists worry a great deal about <strong>computational complexity</strong>, the resources required to carry out a computational task. Particular attention is paid to the number of operations required (time complexity) and the memory requirements (space complexity). The discussion of search algorithms in the previous section considered their time complexity. Also important can be the amount of data exchanged over the network (communication complexity). The complexity of the best algorithm that solves a problem is the complexity of the problem.</p>
<p>The underlying idea is that computation should be minimized—computation is <em>bad</em>. It is bad to compute more than necessary, require more memory than necessary, communicate with other machines more than necessary. In other words, the underlying principle is to minimize the <em>labor of thought</em>, to minimize the computational burden.</p>
<p>This principle translates very well into how we make decisions and design systems in real life. You are computationally kind when you are respectful of the cognitive problems you force others to solve. <a href="#fig-bus-stop" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>8.5</span></a> shows digital signage at a bus stop that has a low cognitive burden. The arrival times, even if estimated, of the next six buses visiting the stop are shown in order. The signage is computationally kind.</p>

<p><strong>Computational kindness</strong> is the principle to consider the cognitive (computational) burden in interactions with others. As <span class="citation" data-cites="ChristianGriffiths">Christian and Griffiths (<a href="references.html#ref-ChristianGriffiths" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> put it,</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>We can be “computationally kind” to others by framing issues in terms that make the underlying computational problem easier.</p>
</div>
<p>Computational kindness and politeness can be at odds. Etiquette suggests to figure out how to spend the evening out by asking “What do you want to do tonight?” That places the cognitive burden of the decision on the other party. They have to figure out your preferences unless you will go along with their decision or they do not care to consider your preferences. It is computationally more kind to constrain the problem presented to the other party. You can state your preferences—“I want to go to a movie”—or provide a limited set of options to choose from: “Let’s go to McDonald’s or Taco Bell followed by either a movie or playing pool at the sports bar.” Computational kindness reduces mental burden but can be detrimental to your relationships.</p>
<p>Why are folks more likely to schedule meetings when you ask “Can you meet tomorrow at 10 am?” instead of “What days and times next week are convenient for you?” The first question specifies constraints of the solution space. Now I do not have to spend mental energy going through the open slots in my calendar, assemble a list of possible days and times for a meeting, send them back to the inquirer and wait for a response. All I have to do is check my calendar against a narrow constraint: tomorrow at 10 am. The first question is computationally kind, its constraint reduces mental burden. The question about convenient days and times is computationally cruel.</p>
<p>The more polite response when someone tries to schedule with you is to say “I am flexible”. It is also the computationally most cruel one because it passes the buck of computation to the inquirer. They have to do all the work to narrow down the large number of possibilities. Saying “I can do Monday at 2 pm and Wednesday at 4 pm” is computationally kind because it reduces their burden to selecting from two options. And if neither of those work they will come back with another day and time—which you can likely accept because you are flexible.</p>
<p>Our brains are sophisticated computing machines. If we design algorithms to make the best use of resources, then we can also strive to make everyday tasks more computationally friendly to our brain. Opportunities are everywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restaurant policies to secure a table have very different levels of mental labor. An open seating policy means whoever gets to an open table first gets to sit down. Customers will hover, constantly checking on which tables might open up, anxiously awaiting their turn. A policy where patron check-in upon arrival, can visit the bar, and are being told when their table opens up has a much lower cognitive burden for the patron, but is less computationally kind on the restaurant.<br>
<br>
A reservation service that guarantees you a table has the lowest stress level for the patron and the highest computational burden for the restaurant. Unless the restaurant knows how to take a reservation but not how to hold a reservation.</li>

<p>Assignment: Designing a Parking Lot</p>
</div>
<div class="assignment-container">
<p>You are operating a mall or large venue and are designing a parking lot for visitors of the space. Four designs are being proposed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A standard grid of lanes leading away from the venue with parking spaces on both sides of the lane.</li>
<li>A standard multi-story parking deck.</li>
<li>A single lane leading away from the venue with parking spaces on both sides of the lane.</li>
<li>A helix-type structure that winds upward from the ground level where the venue is located. Parking spaces are accessed directly from the helix.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Rank the four designs in terms of computational kindness to drivers.</li>
<li>Are parking lot designs you find in real life paying attention to computational kindness considerations?</li>
<li>Can you think of other designs or technologies that balance the tradeoff between mental labor of finding a parking spot and convenience?</li>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography
--->
<p>Consider the following scenario.</p>
<p>Bob and Alice are pen pals and are sending letters to each other by snail mail. At one point, Bob wants to send Alice a package that contains a valuable item. Unfortunately, thieves have been breaking open packages and stolen the contents. To prevent that from happening, Bob places the item inside a box and places a lock on it. The problem now is, how can Alice open the lock without having the key to it? One option is for Bob to communicate the lock combination by some other means to Alice. If it is a keyed lock, he could send the key to her in another mailing. In any event, he does not want to include the key in the package itself, that would be pointless. And sending the combination or key separately still comes with risks. The information could be intercepted and when a thief gets their hands on the package with the valuable item they could steal it.</p>
<p>How can Bob send the item safely to Alice and she is guaranteed to receive it without exchanging information about the lock itself?</p>
<p>The solution lies in asymmetric cryptography, also called asymmetric encryption. Prior to the invention of asymmetric encryption secrets were sent around that enable recipients to decrypt messages. The obvious problem of symmetric encryption is that if someone gets hold of message and decryption key, they can decipher the message. Everything hinges on keeping the keys safe.</p>
<p>How could Bob and Alice handle the situation without exchanging secrets (keys) about the box? It involves two keys. When Bob sends the package to Alice, he attaches his lock to the box. Upon receipt, Alice attaches her lock as well and sends the package back to Bob. He recognizes the package came from Alice and removes his lock, then sends it back to Alice.</p>
<p>Alice now receives the box that contains the valuable item protected with her own lock. She uses her own key to open it and retrieves the item.</p>
<p>Only the owners of the keys used it to lock and unlock the box. The keys were never exchanged. This came at the expense of sending the package back and forth a few times. This could be optimized in the following way: suppose we use a special (single) lock with two keys: a key anyone can use to lock it, but a key unique to Alice to unlock it. Alice shares the first key with anyone who sends her packages and keeps the key to unlock a secret (shares it with no one). When Bob sends a package to Alice, he locks the box with her public key. When he sends a package to Fred, he secures it with his public key.</p>
<p>This is essentially how most messages traveling over the internet are secured, based on a pair of related keys.</p>
